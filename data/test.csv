0,"I stayed here for a weekend and they made my stay so pleasant. Located in a great spot on Bourbon street, you just get out of the hotel and they party is right outside. We got an upgrade to a bigger and more private room in the back of the hotel, so we could get good sleep while people were still partying at late hours. The upgrade came along with a nice wince happy hour and breakfast Buffett which made it totally worth paying for.",5
1,"I will forever be calling upon Delicious Designs whenever I need some tasty and beautifully crafted desserts. When I met Leigh Anne and saw her work, I immediately knew that she was the woman for the job to create our wedding cake. Leigh Anne is incredible and pays such close attention to detail. She listens to what it is that her customers want and makes sure that everything is exactly the way you want it to be. Everyone at our wedding raved about how beautiful and delicious the cake and tarts were. I highly recommend this bakery!",5
2,I personally had only ordered the Homicide boneless and regular and I absolutely love it. It is a bit pricey for the portion though but that doesn't stop me from getting my usual. But please be cautious if your tolerance level for spicy food is low because the Homicide wings are extremely spicy but...tasty lol,4
3,We eat here pretty much everytime we go to Tarpon Springs.  The staff is always very nice and the gyros are amazing.  Their pita bread is just the best.,4
4,"I've been here about 3 times. I never go when I want a huge change--usually just a trim or to get my bangs cut. The prices are pretty cheap ($23 for shampoo, haircut, & blowdry). They have open hours every day and are open late on Friday/Saturday. I've had to wait up to 15 minutes before when they were pretty full. One of the girls who works here, Erin,is actually really, really good. She helped me out when I got sick of my super short haircut and was considering extensions. I ask for her specifically whenever I go.

Overall, though, I only come here when I'm having a hair emergency and need a trim.",3
5,Great hidden tavern grill. Wonderful old place with early 1800 history. Original chili was yummy!,5
6,"My first experience with Sephora was in Paris... so that's not quite fair, but I have experienced Sephora in San Francisco and several places in New York City.  Why is it that many people in Philly just seem to give up,  I go to Sephora to spend money and each time I leave confused.  The staff seems sophomoric and at times I can't find a soul to wait on me.  Other times they are standing around having conversations and not real interested in helping me.  I am 60 years old and I am not just there to buy a lipstick.  The one in Cherry Hill is even worse.  Customer service is the name of the game.",2
7,"We live close by and wanted to try the place.  But as others have mentioned, our dining experience was lackluster and the noise level was extreme.  The food and drinks were not worth the 45 minute wait.

The only thing we liked about the food was the presentation - at least it looked pretty.  I had the Cajun Chicken Pasta, and there was nothing Cajun or spicy about it.  Very disappointed.  My wife had the Seafood Mac & Cheese, which was mediocre and a bit too runny.

The pitcher of Margaritas was small and packed with ice.  We each got a least a typical glass's worth, but it was nothing special.

Our waitress was admittedly inexperienced.  However, her personality and lack of attentiveness didn't help her cause.  

Sadly, I see no reason to go back.",2
8,"This is not a date spot or a place to go for a formal event. That being said, the food is great and the staff is friendly. If you're looking for atmosphere, stay away. But if you just want some great food and don't want to spend an outrageous amount of money, this place is perfect. Will definitely go back.",4
9,"My husband and I stopped by to try Angelo's gyros and philly cheese steak. This visit we opted for just the main items. We did not get a fries. Both items were big. I felt that you got what you paid for. My gyro was stuffed with beef. Some of the meat was dried out. The tzatziki sauce tasted like plain yogurt and sour cream mixed together. I like my tzatziki sauce to have dill, parsley or mint flavor to it. I would have been happy with any seasoning. The sub was also packed with beef. My husband said it was decent sub. We are both going to go there again maybe during the day when the kitchen is busy and items are fresher.",2
10,"Our time at the Terrell House this weekend was beyond perfect.  This B&B is one of the most beautiful places I have seen.  Miss Linda and her staff went above and beyond to ensure our time with them was memorable.  The suite at the Corner Store was perfect for my husband, my self and our 16 year old daughter.  A little slice of heaven..... Southern hospitality at its finest.",5
11,"Wish I could give them 0 stars!  First - they lied about the Jeep I purchased.  The Jeep color I wanted only was available out of state so they had it shipped.  I wasn't too fond on the price but they told me ""it has a tow package"" etc.  Well, it didn't, and then when it came in, they acted like I was crazy because I complained about it not having the options we discussed. They promised me $399 a month... when I got the paperwork it was $430... they wouldn't budge on the price even though we had already agreed on the price and I was told ""just don't buy a cup of coffee every morning for the next 6 years.""   Second... I had the worst experience with their service department.  I took my vehicle in for inspection and they told me, that my not even 3 year old vehicle needed all new brakes, rotors, etc.  I was going on vacation and needed my car and to pass inspection so I paid hundred and hundred of dollars to them to have everything replaced.  While I was on vacation, my brakes started smoking.  Took it to a mechanic and needed to have the ROTORS AND BREAKS REPLACED AGAIN... We were left on vacation without a car for 3 days (TERRIBLE) and when I called, and spoke to the service manager to tell him that whatever they did was wrong and everything was smoking and needed to be replaced again just weeks after they replaced them, he said to me ""What do you want me to do?"" .  So I had to shell out ANOTHER $500+ to FIX their mistakes.  Do yourself a favor, drive to Morgantown, heck Lancater or Boyertown.",1
12,"I went in for a mani and pedi. My student was a nice person and we chatted. However it took 3 hours and my hands just look terrible. The feet are fine and feel great. Hands, just terrible. No one came and checked in if the work was done properly. I'm fine that it takes longer, they are there to learn. However, I shouldn't have been charged for the manicure (pedicure yes) or at least have someone else redo my nails. See the pictures for yourselves, this is 15 minutes out!

Edit: just wanted to add that when I removed my shoes, my pedi was ruined. I asked if it was ready to put shoes on and I was told yes. 2 stars only because at least my student was nice but 0 for the service (34$!)",2
13,"I've been here before and had an awesome bartender. Today at happy hour is a different story. They have a middle aged woman behind the bar, who repeatedly curses at customers. She even got into a verbal personal bashing arguing with one customer. It was so uncomfortable, I probably won't be coming back. Its a shame because their beer selection is awesome. Management should look into replacing such a toxic person.",1
14,"No credit cards =  no good for business. Good local South Philly fare though. Service is adequate as is atmosphere. recommend Victor Cafe much, much more.",2
15,"My wife and I have gone here 5 times now in the last couple months. We love it! Savory food. Great pulled pork and chicken. We've gotten the sandwiches, ribs, salads, baked potatoes, and mac and cheese here - never in one sitting, haha. We keep trying more items, because everything we've had so far here is delicious! The one thing we do continuously get is a glass of Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, they even have it on tap - very hard to find in the Indy area!  Love the atmosphere too. It's not huge inside, so you may wait a while if you have a large group. There are fun things to check out near by too, like Dare Devil Brewery and AJ Foyte's winery.",5
16,"Taco Tuesdays is my jam! The line type serving is a lot o like chipotle, but the tacos are better. I believe I got the tacos with all of the dressings on top. Highly recommend if you want to get a quick bite to eat downtown. There isn't a lot of seating when it gets super busy, however if you come at a non peak time you won't have any issues. 

Unlike a few other taco shops you can take a handful of chips from a heated machine, which is a nice touch. Choose your own salsa and refill your own drinks. You can also get beer here which is a nice touch when you're having a quick taco any day of the week. 

The atmosphere is pretty much expected for a taco place, and the price is great for what you get. I've only been here once, but recommend if you're in the area and need a quick bite to eat.",4
17,Reservations recommended. Great atmosphere and wonderful service. I love their unique spin on island seafood,4
18,What else can you say about great service and a wonderful office staff.,5
19,"Okay if you've never tried Persian food, do yourself a favor and try this hidden little gem!! The chicken kabob is marinated in a savory mixture of spices that leaves it soooo tender and juicy. The beef kabob (koobideh) is beautifully seasoned leaving it also so tender and juicy. The Doogh which is a yogurt drink with a hint of carbonation and fresh mint was one of the best I have ever had!! Go out of your comfort zone and try the food here. It is fantastic. One last thing I would like to say, is the owner is such a nice guy and really cares for his craft. Believe me, it reflex's in the food. Five stars easily!!!!!",5
20,"Yesterday took my family for brunch. Excellent food! Had shrimp and grits, awesome! Service was slow since crowded. The place needs a good scrub! Over all great food!!!",4
21,The service at this place stinks. My wife and I sat at the bar and the blonde bar tender didn't even look at us for about 8 min. We finally ordered and she got her food within 3 minute. The bar tender proceeded to talk to a couple of drunks at the end of the bar for about 20 min and didn't check on my food. It took her 45 minutes to come tell us that my food was coming. Then she proceeded to talk to the drunks again. Never going back because of her. She stinks.,1
22,The original plain fro yo! Has the right amount of tang and zip. No topping needed. Obsessed.,4
23,"The vegetarian wraps are delicious, and the location can't be beat. You get some amazing food for the price too.",5
24,"Impossible to reach anyone on the phone.  If you call to speak with a doctor you get told that a nurse will call back but when they do, they don't leave a message.  If you call them, prepare to be on hold for 45 minutes on the phone and for noone to answer at all.",1
25,"This place is pretty good for a couple of things, the Brussel sprouts and the cooked oysters. I've tried many other main courses that just didn't wow me and took off stars for that. Service was good at least!",3
26,"It's a nice, local, neighborhood joint. Acts a kind of a neighborhood hub. Good cookies which is key, good sandwich's and I am told the soup is good too although I have never had it. Breakfast or lunch, you're good either way.",3
27,"I bought a month membership in the low $19.99 bed. It didn't give me a tan at all, so don't waste your money. All of the workers were very rude (with exception to 1 girl who is new and was nice). Customer service skills are lacking... When you walk in the TV is cranked up and they make you feel like your a bother!",1
28,"Beer: Excellent. The only reason to go here. However, you can only get one beer at a time, even if it's a 4 oz. pour. The waitress gave me some baloney excuse about how they don't want the beer to sit out that long. If your beer goes bad that fast, you've got a problem. They also have a card that tells you that you should only order a pint of beer if you're really serious about drinking, and they suggest you use caution if you order a pint of beer with an abv of over 7%. Woah, a whole pint!?!

Food: mediocre at best. Everything we had could have been better in some way. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Ceviche was just a scoop of fish sitting in vinegar, street corn was overcooked, crab tacos were dry, burger was decent but small, donut was burnt on the outside. The burger came with a pint of beer (look out).  The waitress asked me what kind of beer I wanted. How am I supposed to answer that question when you won't bring me multiple small pours?  I'd have to sit there for two hours before I could make a decision. 

Service: below average. Hostess didn't say a word, I don't know my server's name, and it took too long to get our check. She would not budge on the multiple beers thing. I'm sure that's policy, but I've never been to a restaurant, especially a mediocre one, and been told no for any reason whatsoever. I'm a grown up. I think I can handle two four-ounce beers at once.

Overall, this is a pretty pretentious, disappointing restaurant with really good beer. If you've got a bunch of tattoos, a sick new haircut, and like being told how much you can drink at a bar, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, get a growler to go and order a pizza or something.",2
29,"This place gets 5 stars for the macaroni and cheese, 1 star for the fact that our bartender kept leaving the bar for extended periods of time so we couldn't order anything.  Someone actually had to go find an employee to have them send her back up.  This may be the best mac and cheese I've ever had at a restaurant.  And don't be fooled by it being listed as an appetizer, it's big enough for a meal.  Go eat it!  Now!",3
30,"Good (a.k.a. only) choice for frozen yogurt in Manayunk. The yogurt flavors are extensive and the topping bar has an overwhelming amount of fruits and candies to chose from. I also like the option of turning your creation into a smoothie. 

What I dislike about Whirled Peace is the layout... when it comes to FroYo people can be indecisive and want to taste-test or play around with the flavor combos. This makes it difficult for someone, ME, who is very decisive about her yogurt selection, have to wait around during the hemming and hawing, or cut around you to the toppings. Either way, the layout is a little annoying. Also, I find it a bit expensive. But it does hit the spot when you have a fro-yo craving.",3
31,"This place was okay. The service was fast and good and the options pretty decent.., but while it tasted good ..hubby and I both had stomach issues after. Maybe just a fluke but I am weary to go back because of it. I would try this place again if in a pinch but it would not be my first choice.",3
32,"No Menu, No Drinks, and  it's the BEST Truck food you'll ever have!!! You might not know what you are getting but it will be amazing. He doesn't sell beverages so pick one up on your way. Don't try to get 2 because you'll be sure to get yelled at and the rest of the 20 people waiting patiently in line with hear about it too. Basically the Soup Nazi. of carts lol. Worth every bit of the wait. And you won't be able to stop thinking about that food. I'm so glad he's back. :)",5
33,"Monthly lunch with my fellow colleagues the other day and the person assigned to get lunch ordered from Fresh and had it delivered. 

My selection was the Chopped Italian salad. The salad consists of mixed greens, salami, smoked turkey, tomato, garbanzo beans and parmesan cheese served with the house vinaigrette. The salad was lacking for me. I think such a salad would be so much better with a few more Italian-esque ingredients in it, perhaps a little more anitpasto like. I know, it's not advertised as antipasto but c'mon....this salad was boring.  Throw in a couple of olives, some artichoke hearts, some sliced pepperoncinis. Maybe my tastebuds were having an off day but the salami wasn't very flavorful either. Charge a couple dollars more for a more inventive salad. Please!

I do want to give them another chance since so many reviews on here are glowing. Maybe I need to stick with a panini or something but I really do love salads for summer lunches.",3
34,"I like it, I think the concept is awesome. They wait kills me though. I'm sure give a bit more time and things will calm down some. I will definitely stop by once in a while but I also really like another local ice cream shop in Seminole heights area that makes unique flavors too. That one is still a favorite, time will tell if icesmiles will steal my heart. 
The ice cream is very creamy and the flavors do evolve, they say they add new flavors every 1-2 weeks. I like that they add toppings too.",4
35,"My Daughter and I ate here yesterday for lunch after a doctor's appointment nearby and we loved the pizza and the slices were a pretty good size and the staff were very polite. The young man working the register was really helpful by bringing the 2 slices on a tray right to our table and we both got another slice each, that is how good the pizza was and when next time we see the doctor nearby, we will be returning to this restaurant for lunch. And we saw a lot of Jefferson staff eating there too!",5
36,I've been on the Natchez twice this year.  Once doing the dinner cruise (which is overpriced in my opnion but has very good bread pudding) and once without.  I feel like if you paid that much money to go on the paddlewheel that you probably should eat before and that way you can enjoy all of the sights of the ride so definitely eat before rather than do the dinner.  The food was good but it made no sense to pay for it with the cruise when you'd miss half of the cruise.  Nice people on the ship.  There's a mini steam room that's pretty cool for kids.,3
37,What a wonderful little spot! We enjoyed the service and the food. Too much to finish. The Quesidillas and steak was excellent.,5
38,"To the owner, 

As a big fun of Japanese food, I have been a five-year customer to the restaurant (at least once a month, almost every week in its golden days). But after today, I have to say I will not go there any more.

I know it's a Japanese restaurant that ran by a Korean couple (maybe the husband is from Japan), but to be fair enough, the food is quite good, compared to most Japanese restaurants in town. Also loved the green tea candy. So after a few times of price increase, I was still a fan.

However, the horrible thing about the restaurant isn't its food, or service. It's the damn waiting time! I had the experience of waiting for over one hour just to get a sushi roll (yes that's the only thing I ordered), and almost 90 mins for a take-out delivery while I was waiting in the restaurant (California combo, again it's just one person portion of food). It's not just two examples. I had those awfully long waiting experience for couple times (all in 2016 tho).

So I honestly don't know what is happening in the kitchen. I have tried to go there for lunch, dinner, weekdays and weekends. But no exception, I have to wait for a looooooong time. My friends noticed that too. The thing is we all notice it stared in 2016 (or maybe even late 2015). So I am truly wondering what's going on? Even with the most inefficient process, I shouldn't have needed to wait for an hour or longer to get my food! I am not talking about ordering food for a dozen of people, I am talking about ordering food for just one or two persons!

Ok anyway, I guess I am just so upset that I had so many times of unpleasant experience with the restaurant and it's not because of me disliking the food. 

So today, I ordered the food again, using ubereat (whatever it's called), hoping it would be different. Again, it made me waited for 70 mins to get my food delivered (one person portion). I know it's not because of the uber delivery as it only took 10 mins to deliver the food to my home (the app tracks each step). Anyway, I finally realize that my time just can't be wasted on this restaurant any more. I decide to stop.

I was a big fan. Such a shame!",2
39,"Thouroughly disappointed by this one; I litterally starved myself up until 6pm to save every bit of room in my stomach for this night... I stopped at 5 different food trucks only to be met by sup par food and astronomical prices. 

My stops included SAMOSA DEB: $10 for Curry chicken with rice and Samosa - Horrible! Rice was overcooked to the point it was unrecognizable. It was mush. There was no curry. It taste more like a bland Indian dish which I have never had. The spices were there but there was no salt. The dosa was mushy. It was disgusting! 

Next stop K-TOWN KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN: $8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked Korean Style. Save your time and your money and go straight to Cafe Soho! The wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken. What a let down. 

Then on to THE COW AND THE CURD: $14 for gloriFRIED cheese and a frozen lemonade. It was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick. Sadly enough this is what I enjoyed the most. What left the bitter tast in my mouth from the visit to this truck? I was with friends from Atlanta who came to Philly for the Night Market so I wanted to share. I asked the OWNER for an extra dish to split the curds and his reply ""NO, WE HAVE NO EXTRA DISHES. TRY USING A NAPKIN.'' As I looked behind him to mounds of extra paper containers. Wow, way to loose a customer buddy. 

Now on to RELISH: $8 for Chicken In Waffles, yes people pieces of chicken were chopped up and  infused in the mini waffles, add a pat of maple syrup butter on top, yum yum. Sounds amazing right??? Yeah that's what I was thinking until I bit in to the waffle and my pallet was met by the DISGUSTING taste of DARK MEAT CHICKEN. My entire body quivered as I spit the waffle in to a napkin!  Come on RELISH, you should disclose this as not everyone has the stomach for dark meat...in the trash it went.

I will not be returning to this Night Market! I saw the reviews but I really tried to give this one the benefit of the doubt. We were so disappointed we ended up driving to Jim's Steaks in West Philly to satisfy our food cravings. I will give the one in Chinatown a try in the Fall. My suggestions to my Foodies, avoid this one...",2
40,"Really cute, cozy place. The chocolate gelato was good and it was nice enough to sit on the back patio. The gal at the counter wasn't exactly friendly, which was awkward. I appreciate the bin for the plastic cups and spoons to recycle them!",4
41,"I'm just going to say try the Wing Sauce Pizza, get it with a side of Blue Cheese or Ranch,  it will change your life.",3
42,"It's not great but it's not as bad as the other reviews, either. If you go in here looking solely for vintage clothing, you will come away disappointed as there is quite a bit of newer clothing on the racks. 

That said, you can find some hidden treasures from time to time and you're more likely to find a vintage trinket instead of a vintage tee. Go in with an open mind, no expectations and just have fun.",3
43,"We had such a great meal at Spiro's tonight! Neither my dining companion, nor myself had been there previously. We both had a Greek salad, which was prepared table side. I had the Dolmades, and my coworker, the combo plate which had moussaka and dolmas and lamb (which he could not stop raving about). To our surprise our server brought dessert on the house, since we had never dined there before, it was such a nice touch! Ben our server was fantastic and knowledgable. We are both in the industry so we felt guilty about staying until the restaurant closed, but we were just so comfortable and well fed that we lost track of time. Spiro's is very close to my house, it will definitely be my new regular spot. Thank you Ben, and the whole Spiro's crew, for a great time to compliment a rare night off! You rock!",5
44,"i was staying at the lovely Hotel Monaco (to which this bar is connected to) and figured that I would give this place a try.  The vibe is just a little uptight.  A bit like a sports bar.  I attempted to venture upstairs when I was accosted by a very tall, very bald doorman who looked like he was going to burst a blood vessel as he brusquely steered me away from that area, explaining that it was only for diners.  Ok Max Headroom!  Get your prescription changed.",1
45,"Went here for the great food I had experienced before. 
After HORRIBLE service, flagging down the waitresses, & being told they were out of all drinks except alcohol & water, my friends and I left leaving cash at the table to cover our tabs but did not tip. The staff proceeded to call my boyfriend a nigger & follow my friend outside threatening to call the cops.  I was disappointed in the wait staff but their intolerance & bigotry will definitely prevent me from ever going back.",1
46,"Good cut and value at $14 but over an hour wait and out of coffee by 9:30 AM on a Sat morning.  Forgetaboutit.  

You need to have more than a single barber working on a Sat. morning.  Like a restaurant not being staffed adequately on a Fri/Sat night.  

Either get here when they open on Sat or roll the dice on how long you will wait.  

A barber that is adequately staffed with upscale amenities would enjoy at least a steady business in the Clayton/University City area and probably rake it in if they had good barbers and advertising.",3
47,"Pretty decent banh mi. We loved the fresh baked bread, although would've liked it spicier and more acidic- the slaw was a bit boring. More pate would have been nice as well. This is definitely not the place to go for ambiance, it's a counter tucked inside a convenience store but the food is better than you'd think from the atmosphere.",3
48,"I just went to this bar. I had a lot of fun. They have a great song selection and their drinks are cheap. It's a no-frills kind of place. I asked the bartender about one of their beers that I had never heard of and she said, ""uh... it's like, regular beer."" O...K....??? Don't go here for the best selection of micro brews.

The only real criticism that I have is the smoke. As a nonsmoker, I try and avoid smoke. Why risk the consequences of a vice that I don't even have? The amount of smoke in this bar is pretty disgusting. I was there for a few hours and not only do my clothes now stink like cigarettes, but literally, my eyes sting a bit.

Generally good except for that one thing.",3
49,Jalepeno margaritas. Grilled artichokes. Mac and cheese. Amazing.,5
50,"This is my delivery location...and I order Papa John's a good amount. The pizza is consistently good, more or less on time, and I like that they're generous with their toppings. I've ordered from other locations and it just didn't seem as fresh.

The delivery guy is pretty chill, too.",4
51,"Nayla is such a jewel.  She takes what can be a painful experience and makes it quick and easy, with great results!  I've also gotten pedicures and a facial here -- I can't say I've ever been disappointed.  The facial was one of the best I've had.  Everyone that works here is always smiling from the minute I walk in the door until I leave.  I highly recommend Pia's St Pete to everyone!

Also, if you park in the garage next to Pia's, they can validate your parking ticket.  But I've always found street parking one block south, which is only $2 tops.  There is a great sandwich place in the same plaza, so if on a lunch break, I can stop and get something to eat right there.",5
52,"Yesterday was my first experience at Thai Thanee.  The space was large and inviting.  As far as I could tell, there was only one waitress, but she was personable, attentive and fast.  

The chicken satay ranks among the best that I've EVER had, moist tender and very flavorful.  The basil with chicken was very good, even if not quite as spicy as I would have liked.  All in all the experience was very good.  I'll definitely be back to sample more of their menu...",4
53,"Staff happily sat our big group outdoors as we were unable to enjoy ourselves in the sweltering heat indoors. Forever grateful for that as there are only two big tables for two parties out back. We lucked out that night. Was happy they brought everyone's sushi out at same time. Waitress was very friendly and attentive though our group requested water few times from other staff and we only received it as we were paying bill. There was a big salmon bone in one of my rolls, which was scary, but overall I was very happy with my order. I tried my friends chirachi bowl and found some of the fish to taste less than fresh so I completely understood why he didn't finish it. Two rolls and a small beer was $40 before tip. Not a great feeling there, but when they are the only sushi game in town, what can you do?",3
54,"Spider, spider everywhere! Best for the Halloween day ;-) We had to literally kill a few spiders inside the washroom and one nearby the bed. Worst hotel I ever lived... Even non-smoker room smell smokey, tiles and fixtures were broken (check the posted pics), and the water was dripping all night. The whole corridor felt damp and smell nasty :-0 We were forced to stay here, as there wasn't anything else nearby, and we were unfamiliar of the city, and it was 9:00 at night to search another after 8 hours of driving :-(",1
55,"Pretty typical Mexican restaurant. Good chips & salsa. Margaritas are pretty decent. I have the chimichanga. I liked it. If you're in the area looking for good food and a good price, id go here. Prices are good and the food comes quickly.",3
56,"I had the crabcakes and everything about the whole experience felt like I was in a hobo nursing home with bland food & terrible decor. Flavorless, great for grandparents with dead taste buds. I regret spending my lunch here... at least service was fast and my waitress super attentive.",2
57,"Totally non-dog friendly, unlike 95% of Manayunk.   Ashame since it's accross from the dog park.  I'll be giving my $ to the dog friendly Main Street Market from now on.",1
58,Horrible Customer Service...I received this message from Megabus regarding my trip from Reno to Sacramento. It came 28 minutes before my bus was scheduled to depart. As I reached the 130 minute mark and calling get half witted responses making it myself and the 15 other waiting passengers fault still no further update on my bus. I called Megabus  when I found out they don't take calls after 6. It is 7:50. No update or communication on their part and the site says no refunds can be awarded until the trip is complete. This is the worst customer service and respect for patrons I've ever seen. Not only is a refund due but an apology. Hardworking Americans do not deserve the treatment given by Megabus.,1
59,Had a great view but too many plants in the Windows. Large seating dining broke up into sections around a large bar area. Very nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Large menu. My hubby ordered the Ribeye and fries. They seasoned and cooked it perfectly. I ordered the chicken carbonara. Unfortunately it's without the egg but was very good anyway. They don't serve bread nor salad with the pasta dishes. The steak came with salad. Their gooey cake is a must.,3
60,"The worst Italian food I have ever tasted!!! I'm far from Italian, but I can make a MEAN lasagna & spaghetti myself compared to this place. 1st of all, we waited 45mins patiently w/ a hungry Hubby, 2yr old, 7yr old, & myself. When we finally got seated, the waitress was very polite, but forgetful at times. Didnt drink any alcohol or sodas but the lemonade was very tart & the garlic bread was not-so-fresh...had to request for some fresh bread after my family devoured the 1st basket from starving & waiting for so long. I ordered the stuffed shells & chicken parmagiana. The salad was very tasty; however, they only have Italian dressing...no ranch or anything else. I am not a picky eater & rarely complain, but the stuffed shells & parmagiana chicken tasted HORRIBLE!! The chicken was very bland & the stuffed shells were hard & overbaked. The meranera sauce tasted like it was old or aged too long (if there's ever such a thing, lol). I could not bring myself to eat my entree. I had to send it back. I heard the lady at the table next to ours say the salmon was good, so I figured the salmon might be safe. It was actually very good! I was still very disappointed after this restaurant was referred to me by many. I felt like they got an easy $50 bucks out of me. I would have rathered gone to the olive garden or macaroni grill. If u r looking for an awesome authentic Italian cusine restaurant in Tucson, I highly recommend Contessa off of Ina Rd. The only reason we didn't go there is b/c it was out of the way from where we were going.  It's pretty far from where we live but always worth the drive. Everything is freshly made & u can definite tell the difference! I'm sorry Caruso, but I don't think my family will be coming here ever again!",1
61,"it was a bad dining experience i ever had...
first of all, it was 80 degree, they turn off the AC after abound half hrs we sat down.  The cold dish: spicy chicken we use to order everytime taste awful, then we ask about it, the server told us the main chef quit.  After we finish the meal, walk out the door, our server chased after us said we did not pay tips, we were shock and embarrassed, cos we did pay more than 15%, so we went in again to have them do the calculation, but the cashier girl had bad attitude, she only respond me one word: ""i forgot"" i was so upset... last.. 4 out of 7 of us got stomachache after eating over there,  one of my friend even need to stop by the gas station for this emergency.  So, never again....",1
62,"Good lunch special. One spring, soup and an entree for $8. Nothing spectacular, it was good. Small place off Nolensville. I recommend it for lunch. Smiling Elephant and Siam are better in my opinion but this place is fine. Nice waitstaff, good service. We got our order quickly.",3
63,"Very eh service today. Both employees put forth zero effort to be friendly. Sweet tea and unsweet both empty. Most all the shakers on the tables were half full or less. There is always something to do other then being on your cell phone behind the counter. 

Still good pizza and pepperoni sticks. So three star not two.",3
64,"The service is HORRIBLE!!! Server added 20% gratuity on our check without our consent and there are only three of us. We planned to let it go, but even worse, they tax on the gratuity! I dont what they think, but it is very unrespectful and stupid. The food is also getting less and less. Would never recommend any friend to go again.",1
65,"OK so I've been in chalfont for most of my life and ninos (what it used to be called) and spatolas (what it is now and has been for awhile) was pretty much the only place in town for pizza. Well I must say I haven't been too pleased with the quality of their food for a little over a year now at this point. Their pizza is very blah, not much flavor, their cheesesteaks are fatty, meat doesn't fill the roll. I also had a tuna hoagie from there recently that was by far the worst tuna I have ever had. I never thought Id say this but I would have rather gone to subway! The only thing that saves me from giving it a 2 or a 1 star rating is their cesar salad. I have been getting a chicken cesar salad from their lately, the lettuce has always been very fresh although it is tremendously overpriced. I've never really ate there to comment on the atmosphere, but most of the people seem very cold and be careful if your an attractive girl, my girlfriend was stared at by the 5 guys working there the entire time we were in there, awkward!",3
66,"THE BEST restaurant in Philadelphia, period! We've been coming here for years & it is & always has been consistently AMAZING! Everything is fresh & made to order. It is always busy, which is great. The service is always friendly, efficient & smooth! Even when it gets crazy busy here, it's always ""service with a smile!"" Nothing is too much to ask for, more napkins, ice.. whatever! I love the staff, they work very hard! The chefs are also so nice & friendly. It's really cozy & friendly here, they always remember us & greet us with big smiles! I love these gals... and boy oh boy, can they filet a fish or what?!   We LOVE the Shrimp Pil-Pil, of course the Octopus, salads are great....Branzino! Oh, & save room for the RICE PUDDING!  The best I've ever had! THANK YOU D'mitri's!",5
67,"Good location. Good food. Nice people working there. Subs are comparable to other sub shops and are actually quite tasty. If you stay there and watch them make your sammie, they can't mess up. But I do say just watch, because several times they have forgotten something here and there that I have added to my order. Or, I hate mayo, sometimes they just really badly want to put it on no matter that you've subbed for Ranch instead. 

If you order online and expect campus delivery, be prepared to wait. Sometimes, up to over an hour. While I get they are busy, it is not speedy like other places. Sides are sometimes free with a meal, sometimes there's a fee --I don't understand that drama.",4
68,"Room was clean, bed was comfortable. We checked in late on a Saturday night as we were traveling and so were several others at the time. Location is close to the highway and the mall, so it was convenient. Hotel was very nice.
There's a bar downstairs with some very loud patrons, but not unruly. Drinks were pricey, but they were worth it. Theur food is a little on the high end, but I can't speak to quality as I didn't order. Their late night menu had some great options though.

Will definitely stay again next time we travel through the area.",5
69,"点了四个菜 没一个好吃的 不适合中国人吃

70,"I ate at this location twice.  I would say that the burrito is pretty good.  They put sauce over the burrito, which is pretty good. 

On a second occasion I had a Sope which was okay.  Let say I have had better.  There tacos are pretty good.  They put a lot of meat on their tacos.  Also, they have Lengua, which is tounge.  The tortillas are not hand made.",4
71,"Two gripes:

If you're in the sitting section, stay seated, please. It only takes a small critical mass of people to stand up to set forth everyone else having to do it. Those tickets are like 50 bucks. A LOT of us paid extra just to sit down. Don't be selfish. Your concert experience won't be enhanced by standing. The Avett Brothers will still be awesome regardless.

Why is the bandshell oriented so that the crowd has to stare directly into the sun from like 3pm till sundown? Rotate that thing like 90 degrees, please.",3
72,"I love this place. Visiting my folks in Hudson, Florida. This spot is on Hudson Beach across from the Inn at the Gulf motel and restaurant. It has seating outdoors or in with 2 bars. There are daily specials and $2 Killian Red pints all day, everyday. Usual fare for s beachfront grill and a nicely stocked souvenir shop. The top time to come is around sunset where it is an absolutely beautiful sighting. The staff is spread out pretty thin so you must be a bit patient hence 4 rather than 5 stars. If in the area, it's a must!",4
73,I took my family to NY pizza last night. We were the only table in the restaurant on a Friday night. The service was terrible. Our waiter obviously hated his job and could care less about taking care of customers. We ordered a spinach dip for an appetizer and it took over 20 min for it to arrive. The pizza that we ordered was nothing to be excited about and last night will be the last time we visit this restaurant. Management should wake up and make some changes. If you want to be disappointed... Visit this place,1
74,"Ate at this restaurant while attending the Sugar Bowl and had a good time. The place definitely is a ""hole in the wall"". It's located on a busy intersection and the exterior looks run down. We arrived around 6pm and there was already a line. We had to wait about 30 mins before we got a table. The interior was no different from the outside. It was small, it had cheap tables and chairs, and was cramped. 

As with most other reviewers, the food and service more than made up for the rundown decor. Our waitress was nice and professional and food was quick to arrive. We got a dozen oysters, blackened alligator, and seafood basket. Oysters were fresh, the alligator was tasty, and the seafood were cooked perfectly. 

Overall, this was a nice restaurant outside of downtown NOLA. If you can get over the ""hole in the wall"" atmosphere, then this is a place to visit.",4
75,"Decor is fun, modern, and clean. Definitely, not your typical dingy dark barbecue joint ambiance. Pulled pork was very delicious and their sauces were on point! They also have any side option you could ever imagine from collard greens to coleslaw. I recommend the coleslaw and the cornbread.",5
76,"DON'T COME HERE

::::WARNING::::

I am sorry for coming here.  It was the worst meal I ever had, and my friends agree.  I live in a Arab community in NYC and my boyfriend is Moroccan, so I know what Moroccan food is, and this place is not Moroccan. The Lentil soup had was awful.  People that rate this place 5 stars honestly do not  know what Moroccan food is, and I feel sorry for you, you do not know what good food is.  Myself and friends all got the runs and horrible stomach aches, and that is just from trying the food because we didn't finish it, we just couldn't.  The only thing I did like was the fries, that's it.  

When I explain to the Manager that I didn't enjoy the food, he was rude and obnoxious.  After we paid, just out of respect, the manager followed us outside and made a scene and told us to get the F out of here just because we told him that we didn't like his food.  I am sorry, but that is not being a professional at all.  I manage a restaurant and I would be dead crazy to talk to my customers the way he did.  He should not be allowed to serve the public.  

He is lucky we didn't call the Health Dept for causing us stomach pain.

He is lucky that he got this 1 star from me because honestly I wouldn't give him any, if I had the option.",1
77,"We were looking for somewhere new to eat this evening and I happened to remember seeing the sign for this place opening last week. We used to enjoy the restaurant that was in this building before (Five & Diner) so decided to give this new restaurant a try.

Little, well nothing, has changed about the interior of the place. It's still 1950's kitsch diner although the name and menu would be more appropriate to something country or rustic. I'm not sure if the owners just didn't have the money or time to makeover the decor but it certainly is a mismatch. They've even kept the 1950's and early 1960's jukebox pop music which seems strange. 

We decided to order from their  all day breakfast menu. Michael chose an omelet with potatoes and English muffin while I chose the Buttermilk hoecakes (although they are actually pancakes) with a side of bacon. 

The food was mediocre. Michael's omelet was barely warm and the cheese he asked for had just been melted over the top then allowed to sit so long it had firmed up again and congealed. Yes, service was slow and undoubtedly that part of the order was sitting in the window. His potatoes were OK although nothing particularly noteworthy. 

On my end the pancakes were a bit bland. Since I am currently dieting I decided to forgo the syrup and just use a little butter. While they were not inedible by any means they just didn't seem to be quite worth the hefty $6.95 price tag for three pancakes alone. The bacon, however, was tasty and high quality and prepared just as I had ordered it. 

The people seem genuinely friendly for the most part. Our server was a very nice older lady although I don't think waiting tables is really the career for her. While pleasant, she was rather inefficient and prone to forgetting simple things. It's also rude of a server to stand over the patron while they are filling out the charge slip and calculating the tip. 

This is one of those restaurants that seems just on the edge. With a little more attention to the food, some makeover in the decor, and a bit more efficiency in the front of the house and the kitchen it could succeed. However, without those things I'm not sure of the longevity of this business. Normally, in our neighborhood a new opening means a fairly full house for at least a few weeks. When we were there only three other tables were in use and half the dining room was closed. 

We'll probably try it again in a month or so (if they're still open) to see if they've made any changes or progress.",2
78,"Once again St. Louis has spoiled me. The Whole Foods right outside of STL (Brentwood), had got me excited about Whole Foods once more. First with Graeters and secondly (and more often once Graeters appeared more places) with their outstanding to-go sandwiches and pastry selection.

This location, however, lacks an impressive (or even good) pastry section. Their pastry case is all of two or three feet long. The one in St. Louis? Probably four times that length. 

Where were the cream puffs? The non mini tarts? Or any fruit tarts besides mixed berry? Where were the french inspired pastries? Or the vegan ones? Where was any of this?

Instead there were pudding cups (I bought one - it was very pretty and did use very rich chocolate, but was still just a bit better than a normal pudding cup), creme brulee, two types of macaron flavors, and only a few cakes (albeit I am sure you can call in advance to order others as you can at most Whole Foods). There were mini tarts, but all the same mixed berry flavors... There was no layered deserts or tiramisu.

It was just a below average bakery selection and it left me sad (as I had driven there hungry and wanting pastries)

Maybe the other location in Indy will prove more fruitful? (Or pastry case full)",3
79,"One star for the delivery being on time and another for following instructions in notes of my online order...

Too bad the food just didn't do it. In a nutshell, i should've gotten my lazy ass up and drove to Jamaican Ds...

Mac and cheese pitiful... pretty sure there's no cheese... definitely no salt or pepper which means no flavor. At all.

Fried chicken - meh... seasoned but maybe the wrong combo of seasonings... idk...

Jerk wings... i haven't even tasted them yet and it's a shame because from the looks... i don't want to...

Portions are awful... again... maybe jamaican Ds has me spoiled but for $11 i just expected more... more flavor... more cheese... more spice... just more.",2
80,"I have dined at Baguette Deli a handful of times in the past, with my most recent visit being after nearly a year since the previous one. During prior visits, I had always been pleased with the value and quality of the food, as well as the prices. Unfortunately, it seems the place has changed. 

First, the girl taking my order at the counter seemed hurried and became visibly impatient when I took an extra few moments to decide my order, even though there were only two other customers in the restaurant and no one else in line. I have always enjoyed the fresh shrimp spring rolls, but was disappointed to find they were out. In the past, they had been able to make them to order if customers were willing to wait, but when I asked about this, the girl responded with a terse, ""No,"" and seemed to take pleasure in being unhelpful. So I settled on the teriyaki chicken banh mi. Although the bread was crusty and delicious and the veggie toppings were fresh, the chicken was mushy, salty, tasted old, and had the texture of a purée rather than actual meat. In addition, the meat portion was minuscule, which I was somewhat grateful for in this instance because it simply wouldn't have been palatable.

While eating my lackluster sandwich, I overheard the conversation between a customer and the girl at the counter. While placing his order, the customer inquired about the same fresh spring rolls I had been interested in. The girl told the gentleman they were out, but when he asked about having some made to order, she said yes, after she had given me a flat, unapologetic no. 

Despite already being furious, my next, and possibly most significant issue with Baguette Deli, is that they no longer offer free water to customers, which I am reading is a complaint I share with other reviewers. Instead of a pitcher of water with reusable plastic cups that diners could help themselves from, the restaurant now requires patrons to purchase an overpriced bottle of water. I find this practice cheap, greedy, and in the worst possible taste and service. Despite relatively reasonable base prices and good experiences in the past, the new ""nickeling and diming"" tactics, inconsistency, and poor customer service has made Baguette Deli a place I no longer wish to give my patronage to.",2
81,Food was really good. One should come here for crab and atmosphere. If you come for something different prob be disappointed.,4
82,We have known Meridith for many years and through several of her restaurant ventures. We recently used her catering service Aneu for a birthday party and couldn't have been more pleased. Her planning and performance were perfect. The two servers she sent were very professional and the food garnered rave reviews from both our guests and from us. Everything from initial planning to final cleanup went without a hitch and her personal attention to detail was perfect. Highly recommended!!!!!!,5
83,While I want to love 45 Tchoup because it's a Red Sox bar (WOOT!) with a good vibe and darts...the smoke in there is (in my opinion) the worst in the city. I can't breathe and I leave feeling nauseous. I've gone back a few times hoping that I can stand it but ... I can't. I think that if it wasn't for the smoke I would be there at least a few times a week during SOX season.,1
84,"Two co-workers and I came here after flying in from Chicago for an afternoon snack. It was almost 3, so we asked if we could wait until happy hour to order. The place was completely empty while we were there, but the space was well decorated and very open. 

We all ordered cocktails (I got the Mint Julep, which was not great, but then a gin drink that was fantastic), and they were all pretty and tasty. We also ordered Mac and cheese, fries, Brussels sprouts, and a pretzel. I didn't try the sprouts (I really don't like them), but everything else was so good! And the prices during happy hour were a great deal. 

I'll definitely be back next time we go to Reno!",5

86,"Definitely a good place for sushi on a budget. I love to get the bigger, fried rolls. Normally I get raw sushi at other restaurants, but it's either a hit or miss here with the raw selection. I'll get a couple of their sushi combos sometimes, but the rice doesn't taste as sticky and fresh. Again, can't go wrong with the fried rolls... they are huge!",3

88,"A group of five went late in the evening and experienced poor service. The restaurant was clean and there are a lot of tv's to watch sports but not recommended for an enjoyable dining experience. The food was good but overpriced in my opinion. Also, gratuity is added to your ticket. We had a terrible waitress who got drink orders incorrect, forgot silverware, was completely
unpleasant, and never checked on us.",2
89,"My first time coming here was super awesome. So I decide to bring my Mom for my second visit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed and mad that I took my mom here for lunch. We waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up.

Might come back for the drinks but not for the food.",1
90,Rating is really a gift since I have no idea how the sushi is-because this place is closed more than it is open it seems!?  Third time I arrived during their posted business hours-and they were closed.  Three strikes....,2
91,I can say we have been coming to Han D. for the past 7 years or so and have been very happy with our meals .  We like the Americanized menu they serve and the food is better than the other Chinese restaurants in the area . They do not get a 5 as I agree with other posters that each of the few employees have way too many hats to wear. At times I have to get up to hail a waitstaff member rushing by to get their attention for a question or water refill. Hire more staff during busy times !,3

93,"Ordered from grubhub waited an hour and a half for delivery so I called naturally no one picked up for another 20 minutes then when the guy answers his explanation was that they were on break and hadn't made my order yet and gave me the "" oh well"" attitude and didn't offer any kind of compensation.",1
94,Can't believe I'd never been here before- I live right around the corner! Pho Cam Ly is everything I want my pho place to be- unassuming and delicious.

96,"The second time I went here wasn't nearly a good as the first. The beer situation was similar but the mussels were only ok, the broth terrible. The calamari was listed as lightly breaded but was mostly breading. Still a decent place but I guess the meal depends more on the cook that evening.",3

It's very exciting to see all the new restaurants opening up around town and I really want them all to succeed. I've been to Nox  many times now. I have to say it's been so inconsistent last night being the Worst!!!  Waitstaff were inexperienced, appetizers came out with the dinners and only one was hot.  Had to send two out of the three dinners back for various reasons.  As you know Restaurants seem to come and go around here so please guys pay attention and remember you're only as good as your staff.

107,"Three stars is not great. Hibachi should be easy, but this place suffers from mediocre service and food. Sushi was ok but still the highlight of the meal. Hibachi was kinda yuch. They put a nasty teriyaki sauce on everything. It's too heavy. They put it on my lobster, which helped hide the fact that it wasn't fresh. 
The choices on Sam Ridley pkwy aren't great and I had high hopes that this place could be added to my list of options, but alas, no.",3
108,"This Acme is open 24 hours which is good for me. They have a section for gluten free products & other products through out the store are labeled a such as well. The beat time to go to avoid the long lines is definitely late night. 

Their products are a bit higher than other markets I frequent. For the convenience, I will pay that for now. I have encountered several EXPIRED PRODUCTS & have brought this to the manager's attention in the past. MAKE SURE the dates are checked on EVERYTHING before you pay. They are good with accepting returns but SAVE THAT RECEIPT. 

It's a good place to ""pick up a few things"" but heavy duty shopping I'll reserve for elsewhere

*******UPDATE******
Well...keep checking those dates. I returned a month later.... Expired Organics Vanilla Soy Milk (Exp. August 13,2018) for sale.",3

The salon itself felt a little beat up.... considering that they are charging Chicago prices.  But for a nice modern cut and good care, I will definitely keep this place as my salon of choice.",4
110,"I just came back from my first time here since Great Tea closed next door (about four years ago) and since I feel like I can't give any place a fair review without three fairly close together visits, I can only (in good conscience) give this place a four at most.
The server was very pleasant and pleased to speak with a semi-native French-speaker. We shot the breeze a bit, which was nice, then my party and I ordered.
Between us, we'd ordered crêpe á la rivage (with tuna, egg, tomato), gâteau de crêpe au jambon (ham, mushroom, spinach), crêpe de mergeuz et something else (haha, I don't quite recall what he got in it other than the lamb sausage, I'm afraid) and nutella et poire (pear and nutella). 
We shared amongst ourselves and we all rather enjoyed them. The tuna one was less my style, but I couldn't stop raving about the ham. It's perfectly balanced of sweet, savoury and delicious and the paper/wafer-thin pancake had that lovely nutty aroma one can only get from a well seasoned pan. Hints of butter made me happy.
The lamb sausage one was cheese-filled. In fact, none of our orderes skimped on the fillings at all. One gripe from our group was the pear we chose for dessert; none of us save one had this issue, but he'd gotten, it seems, all the pear skins in his portion. Sorry, Dan, but the rest of us were enthralled!
Even after several visits, I don't think I could give above four stars due to pricing. I understand; Rittenhouse, yes, expensive, nonetheless, it may be a bit much for a light meal. The server did, however, cut us a price break. I haven't a clue why, but he charged us about 10% less than we'd expected.",4
111,"I like food trucks. 

I like food trucks that have Poutine. 

I may just be a little biased here, but ALAS, I have found poutine in New Orleans.   For those of you who don't know what poutine is, it's actually a canadian dish originating in quebec.  It is composed of fries, with cheese curds that are sprinkled on top and they melt into a gooey mess as brown gravy is poured onto it.  It's a heart attack in a cup.

Back home in Canada, they have a a lot of different variations of poutines, and there are specialty poutine shops. I often think about poutine, so I was especially excited when I saw it on Foodie Call's menu as they were setting up.  I was so excited, I couldn't wait and I ordered it immediately, I had to wait about 20 minutes for the poutine because they hadn't even started up their burners yet.

Although it didn't taste like home, the poutine was still good in its own New Orleans way.  A little bit of seasoned fries, gravy with debris, and cheese curds.  Cheese curds weren't quite melted into a gooey mess, they were still sort of square and not totally soft.

Plus side, I know where I can poutine for my cravings, I just have to chase this truck down, and now I also know where I can get cheese curds in this city.  As we all know the grocery stores don't carry them.",3
112,"We had dinner here at 10 pm on a Thursday night after driving 8 hours from Dallas, TX to New Orleans.

*nice wine selection 
*brussel sprouts appetizer
*corn and crab bisque
*rib eye steak!!",4
113,"Booking it for New Years Eve, this hotel was chosen mainly for its location, which is amazing.  You are only a block from the river, particularly Penns Landing and Spruce Harbor Park.  It has great views of the Ben Franklin Bridge and the River.  Unfortunately, this was the only positive thing that came out of our stay.  

We had requested for an upgrade suite, but I think we were given a regular room, shoved in a little corner.  We could barely roll in the luggage cart without having to pivot and bump into the walls left and right.  The rooms are average size but had a weird smell to it.  Their bathrooms are smaller than normal.  I assumed the room smell was due to the fact that you are allowed pets into the rooms.  

The Sheraton Club is also a lot smaller as well, with minimal seating for guests.  Pool is small, but I never expect much for a hotel in the middle of the city.  

Hotel, mainly for its location.",3
114,"UPDATE 6/23/12:  So we've been to Tortugas twice in the last year.  The first time, I had a nice big black chest hair (fingers crossed, let's HOPE it was a chest hair) in my taco.  That kept me from wanting to eat there for a looooong time.  Then we just went back recently and sat down in the restaurant.  The food was great, hot, tasted fresh, I can't complain at all about the food.  The server was another story.  We handed her a coupon and she had an attitude and a tone with us, stating that it had to be ""called in and would take a few minutes"".  Then she walked off leaving us standing at the register until someone else came and took care of us.  Listen Tortugas, coupons are incentives that get people's behinds in your seats. We don't want to deal with attitude problems just because we have a coupon that you have to do some extra overhead for.  After such a great meal, we left the restaurant talking about the rudeness of the server.  That's a shame.  See you in another year I guess Tortugas....

UPDATE:  6/5/11:  I can't bring myself to eat here anymore.  The place does not seem clean.  The last time I was there, I found a hair in my taco.....A HAIR.  A big greasy hair.  It's a shame because Tortugas has some things going for it in the food department.  However, with other choices quickly springing up around it, Tortugas needs to get with the program before I'll ever go back there (if ever).  For now, even though it's been months since I ate there, I think about finding that hair every time I think about Tortugas.  And seriously Tortugas, do something about your debit card purchasing system, it's pathetic!  You have to pay money to do debit!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I've always liked Tortuga's, they are okay.  I really enjoy their chicken taco's and the nacho chips that come with the orders are really very good.  

They are not a great place to order take out from, its better to go there and eat.  When I order the chicken tacos to go, I find that they are VERY water logged when I get them home and the once crispy shell falls apart right in my hands.  Generous amounts of chips and salsa are given and that is always appreciated.  I do agree that they are overpriced though.  

They really need to update their debit card system or something, it always takes longer than usual when I'm paying with a card and I think they even have a surcharge for using a card!",2
115,"Because of this Panera Bread's proximity to King of Prussia, Costco, and the movie theater, I've been here at least 4 times. Each time, some different person manages to get my order wrong. 

Don't get me wrong, I love Panera bread, but the service that this location provides is horrible! The first time I ordered a panini and I stood there for at least 15 minutes before I went up and asked about my order. It turns out, ""it never went through"" (although the charge on my credit card certainly did!) The mistakes made in the second/third orders were also relatively small but irritating to fix. How hard is it to take an order for a salad or a sandwich?? Usually the place is pretty empty too =/

I think the 4th time is the last straw. They messed up the salad that I ordered (I asked them to omit some ingredients because of allergy restrictions) and when I checked the receipt, saw they charged me for ""extra""!  So I got back in line holding my salad like a huge idiot, and after a 20minute wait (even though there were only 2 customers ahead of me), it took 5 different people another 20minutes to solve the issue. In total I probably spent about 45minutes just waiting to get the right food. They refunded me the ""extras"" charge, but not the cost of the total bill (about $8). I""m trying not to gripe about 8 bucks, but a 45minute wait is kind of ridiculous.

Passing on this Panera forever =/
Hopefully other Paneras in this area will be better.",2
116,"First off, I loved that there was a free parking lot behind the restaurant, which is rare for restaurants in Nashville anymore.  The restaurant wasn't busy (Monday) but we had great service and really enjoyed our visit.  We ordered six different dishes, and all were excellent and full of flavor.

Overall, the spicy tuna guacamole is the dish that would bring me back.  It's like sushi meets guac.  I wish the potatoes had been crispier, but we ate until we were stuffed anyways.  It was really a delicious meal, and now I understand why the reviews on Yelp are so good!  Oh, and the caipirinha I had was delish too.

I'd come back to Americano to drink and munch on tapas with friends.   Probably wouldn't pick it for a 1-on-1 date night, but definitely for a group who wants to share plates and not get too full on a single dish.",4
117,"I have been to NOLA 3 times and every time I have I have tried different hotels. This hotel was by far very over rated. The price you pay for this hotel is ridiculous considering how tiny the room and bathroom is. The beds were very comfortable but every thing else was not updated. There are over 500 rooms in this hotel and only 3 people working the front desk. We waited over 15 minutes just to get an elevator down to the lobby. 

The positive was the carousel bar which was great ""if"" you can get a seat. If you have a chance try the food in the hotel, that was also great!!",1
118,"If we had a choice of half stars this would be a 3 1/2 star review. 

When we arrived we had to wait in line to be seated in spite of the fact we had pre-purchased tickets. They seated everyone at basically the same time. No one really looked at my ticket either...I could have probably flashed my Epcor bill and gotten in that way too! Lol! 

The venue was uncomfortably hot and stuffy, it took a LONG time to get served and even longer for the drinks to arrive. We had a few sips of our drinks and soon after they flashed the lights for last call. Sigh.

The comedians were funny and engaging. We had lots of laughs and a pretty good time!",3
119,"Wow, a place that makes a GREAT martini. I don't say that often enough. I order dry, they make dry. Seems like it shouldn't be complicated, but it really is at most places. I have no idea about any of the other cocktails, but really the martini is what it should be.

Food-wise, I've never been disappointed, and a highlight for me was the egg-salad sandwich. Not that I would describe the egg salad as, ""What's Up, Tiger Lily,"" good, but good. Worth a try if you appreciate a good cocktail.",4
120,"We were here on a busy Saturday night so that could be why our experience was so sub-par. The service was slow, and the waitress got one of our orders wrong. We had to wait for cutlery when our food had been served and the food was just meh. And it was overpriced to boot.",2
121,"We were in NO on vacay.  This was the best meal we had!  Scallops, shrimp po boy, chicken parm and meatballs were all outstanding.  Everyone from host to bartenders to the security guy could not have been more friendly and helpful. Awesome job chefs. If we lived here we'd be back all the time.",5
122,"Had been curious about Freddy's after seeing them pop up around town. Well, not so any more. Not my favorite burger; tasted like charred meat. Onion rings extra crispy were good dipped in the fry sauce.  Half our order was messed up somehow which the manager attributed to the computer screens messing up. ??  What was most disturbing though was how filthy the place was. The tables were all greasy and had clearly been ""cleaned"" with greasy rags. The floor was dirty and very sticky. It was disturbing to see that the floor was being ""mopped"" with a Swiffer, and food on the floor was just pushed to the side.  I really wanted some custard because the taste we had been given was really good, but after watching the water on the dripping rag being slopped all over the machine we decided not to.",1
123,"This place was ok, it definitely didn't blow my mind. Well, the brussel sprout appetizer did blow my mind because it was fantastic. The entree, though, did not blow my mind. I went simple and got the burger, it wasn't cooked quite the way I ordered it. Additionally, I had removed a tomato slice from my burger because it wasn't quite ripe and I'm not a lover of tomatoes all the time. A waiter walked over and informed me that I could have asked for the burger without the tomato...uh, duh? I have been to restaurants before. I just wasn't hugely impressed. Our waiter was great, though, and super helpful.",3
124,"A new food obsession.
I had never heard of a sushi burrito until I saw someone's excited post that sushi burritos were  here! Although sushi wrapped in a tortilla sounded kinda awful, so many good reviews persuaded me to try it. Silly me, it's not a tortilla, it's wrapped in that flat seaweed used in so much sushi. Too bad, I'm not crazy about seaweed either, but they also offer a sesame rice wrap as well. Bingo! I tried the Salmon with cucumber instead of corn. Loved, loved. All the goodies blended together well and the poke sauce added a little heat. I had a passion fruit/lychee bubble thingy as a yummy dessert. The staff was so helpful with explanations and recommendations. They seemed sincerely interested in giving me a quality experience. They also offer a nice selection of Vietnamese dishes which I will try on future visits, if I can keep from ordering a sushi burrito.",5
125,Wait in line for pancakes???  Seriously??? YES!!!!!!!  The pancakes are amazing and the service was excellent too.     You have to go!,5
126,"Everything here is amazing!!! Pulled pork, ribs, chicken, and all the sides! I haven't tried anything I didn't like.",5
127,"Say what you will about Daniels....but...he did fix the license branches...now staffed with competent, caring...and dare I say FUN people !

In and out in record time...I rarely wait more than a couple of minutes.

BRAVO LICENSE BRANCH STAFF !!!!!",5
128,"Absolutely terrible in every aspect.  My fiancé and I came here on a Saturday at 5:45.  All of the waitstaff were standing around the back of the restaurant looking at us awkwardly.  Eventually the bartender greeted us from behind the bar and pointed to the table where we will be seated.  I ordered ""The Cactus"" margarita, and it was salt lime juice and water.  Not a drop of tequila in it.  I'll give it to them that the salsa was good because of the added chipotle.  However, they have the audacity to charge $4 for an extra basket of stale chips.  Our food came out reasonably quick. My fiancé ordered the chicken fajitas and I ordered the 5-Alarm burrito.  Mine was dry as a bone, bland, and not spicey at all.  I'm reasonably sure that they got a frozen burrito from wava and heated it under a panini press.  My fiancée chicken was also dry and just over all bland.  Then came the waiting. We asked our waitress for the check and then she disappeared for 20 minutes.  I asked her again as she passed by our table, and still had to wait another 10 minutes.

It's a different story if they were the only show in town, but this is Main Street manayunk.  There is no reason for places like this to be taking up space if this is the quality and service they are offering.",1
129,"I really enjoyed my meal here, I was eating alone and there was no WiFi but I actually felt very comfortable! The food is incredibly cheap, I can't remember everything I got but I had a full meal, with dessert, one non-alcoholic cocktail and iced tea with refills and I swear it only came to about 12 dollars! The Cotton Candy drink is insane, so so sweet but so tasty! Could do with a shot of vodka.... :P 
The service was great and they kept me happy all evening. 
I did have some upset stomach that night but as I had been travelling for the previous two days I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with the meal, I was just wrecked and probably ate too much. 
Grand spot!",4
130,"There are some mighty fine donuts at Eddie's Southtown Donuts.  At a lot of places some donuts are great, others not so good, but everything I sampled here were delicious.  

It's in a pretty unassuming location so I don't think it's easy to notice this great place.",4
131,"Pleasantly surprised.  This is the no-frills, greasy takeout joint that's sorely missing from the Main Line.  I had the Orange Beef and found the beef tender.  There was ample sauce, rice and broccoli.  It was considerably better (and cheaper) than the same entree at Chinese Delight in Wayne.",4
132,"I am so confused by this place.

First off, at the relatively young age of 26, I feel like a total Grandma in here! It's full of kids, and by that I mean the 21 year olds who are trying out bars and clubs for the first time. Most seem even younger than that, and these kids have just not learned bar etiquette yet. You will be stepped on, rammed into, and touched by more sweaty people than you thought possible. The space is small and cramped, so I started to feel quite faint from the heat. If there's one way I would describe this place, it would be amateur; seriously seasoned drinkers and dancers need not even bother. There's also an abundance of extremely annoying bachelorette parties here, with every other song ending in a shout out to a pack of young girls who are clearly binge drinking their way to the hospital. 

Anyway, the music isn't bad. The performers are clearly talented and have a good energy that should not be wasted here. Think an even more depressing Piano Man scenario than the actual song. Speaking of Billy Joel, somebody requested actually Italian Restaurant and the band actually played it. Even though it's one of my favorites, really? Playing Italian Restaurant at a dance club? I was shocked when most of the crowd started singing along and seemed to dig it. I guess people can surprise you sometimes. And I guess that the kids these days like piano bars.

Aside from the piano aspect (which is a welcome change in the club scene), this place is a dump. Their drink menu and prices leave a lot to be desired. All the people clamoring for the never ending supply of Jell-O shots kind of grossed me out. The dancing flat out sucks, and most people just sway in a drunken stupor. Leave this stuff for the amateurs, a better time can be had elsewhere.",2
133,"I needed a last minute carpet replacement and R&N came through.  Rob came to the house to measure the room, explained everything in detail, didn't try to upsell/pressure me, and charged a fair price.  Then him and his guys came in the next day, texted with timely updates, and put in the carpet as requested.  R&N made it easy during a stressful time and that is awesome in my book.  Highly recommend.",5
134,"First time at this local restaurant. The meats were tasty but served cold. Collard greens were unusual but not in a good way. Garlic bread and cole slaw lack flavor. The fried green tomatoes were good. The waitress brought our food out, already cold but did not bring us plates or utensils. Had to ask for sauces too. She didn't bring straws with the drinks. She forgot my wine altogether. Food and service need work!",2
135,"Their lunch special really is a good value. For $10 today I was served a very nice salad, fried fish, rice & beans, hush puppies and and ice tea. I've easily spent more than that any other day of the week for a worse lunch. 

I'm not sure... but I think if you come at lunch, you eat the lunch plate... you don't get a choice of anything else. Or at least the server didn't offer anything else. 

The space has been redone but is still a little dilapidated. The ceiling was all warped. I don't know why this bothered me but I couldn't stop looking at it. And our table was wobbly. I hate that. Freaking annoying. 

The food was good... I really liked the salad. The fish was average. Nothing special. The hush puppies tasted homemade... like something grandma would have cooked. Beans and rice were good. I liked that the beans had big chunks of ham in it. The tea was weird. It tasted like it had tobacco in it. Tea shouldn't make me feel like I need to brush my teeth. 

I'm glad I visited. Huge props for good, well prepared food at $10. And I was in and out at lunchtime within 40 minutes.  I'll be back to try other items.",4
136,Neighborhood hot spot. This has always been a great place for chicken  wings and burgers  The servers are hospitable. ML Rose is one of my favorites.,5
137,"This was our first time visiting the tap room. We have been at the main brewery once before where there are twice as many taps, however the selection here is just perfect. Very cool place to sip and chill...bar area, second tier and lounge with leather couches are a wonderful setting to enjoy a few beer samplings. Enjoy!",4
138,"So far I've visited Fat Ham twice; the first time I visited, I was completely blown away.. the second time... well. you will see.

The first time I visited:
- ricotta spread was perfectly smooth and smoky 
- oyster sliders were highlight of the meal-- juicy oysters fried with spicy & crunch batter
- pulled pork was a meh
- charred cabbage was a huge surprise... VERY GOOD
- hot chicken was crispy and spicy..  and actually, too spicy for me. Potato salad was too salty.
- pecan pie.. oh.. pecan pie... 

My first experience was so good that I just had to go back, which I did few days ago. 

Unfortunately, the oyster slider had too much batter (where is my oyster?) and hot chicken was GODDAMN hot. Ricotta and pecan pie were good, though. 

I might give Fat Ham another try, when their menu is updated.",4
139,"If you read the reviews of Hickory Hollow Mall from oldest to latest, you'll see its staggering decline. I went here recently for the arcade, and it's really the only thing left worth visiting. Seriously, about 1/3 or more of the mall is closed and the stores left have the vaguest names you'd probably think I made up on the spot - Today's Fashions, Streetville, etc. I can't recommend this place unless you're already in the Antioch area and want to walk around for its defunct bizareness.",1
140,"Food was good, but overpriced.  Sandwiches came with stale chips.  Although we didn't try any, the beers may be good, but a glass of the house chardonnay which was sweet and simple was $8.  Likewise, mixed drinks were $9 for a small drink.  Our tab for 2 was $85 with tip and included 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks apiece.  Nice atmosphere, but won't be a place we visit often, if we do indeed return.",2
141,"We ate here expecting a lot because of the reviews. We got mozzarella sticks, eggplant fries, and a pizza. The mozzarella sticks weren't hot, the cheese inside wasn't melty. The eggplant fries were fine. The pizza was an overcooked mess. The spinach seemed like frozen chopped spinach that had been freezerburned; it didn't cook down like spinach should but just got super dry and had a weird smell. The crust was really hard and tough. I see a lot of people saying the crust is crunchy here. I like a nice crunchy pizza crust-- I really do. But this pizza crust was incredibly hard and I could barley saw through it with a knife and with TMJ issues I couldn't bite through it at all. We said something to the waitress and she told us that was how it was supposed to be, and if we didn't want it hard we could order it less cooked and have it come out ""partly raw"" next time. Those were her words, I'm not even kidding. I told her that I would prefer fully cooked dough. They gave us $5 off our uneaten pizza. We had taken a few slices and picked at them hoping for edible parts but if we had reassembled everything on the pan we'd have eaten less than two full slices total. I ended up paying $40 including tip for a meal where basically only one appetizer was decent. I am also just shocked at the service we received when I nicely complained about the pizza. Please, please don't tell more customers that if they don't want hard, overcooked dough they should ask for it raw! That's absurd.",2
142,"This place is a bit OTT (over the top) with some of their decor stuff, but maybe this is what life in a Carmel mansion in is all about. There are some fun items, but mostly really large, for some MTV Cribs show space. I liked a few of the chandeliers--it sorta feels like they are copying Restoration Hardware and a couple other places--can't quite put my finger on it. They have big animal statues, bed stuff, shelves, tables, some cool lights, and just lots of really odd exaggerated-size things. It's worth a wander around, but I'm not the target market.",3

Rob, the installer did a fabulous job--what a craftsman!  Thank you GCO for a great retail experience!",5
144,"Great getaway spot for a few days - it is awesome opening up the suite and being right on the beach. Bathroom looks like it was newly renovated and was amazing. We stayed in the ""suite"" but there are no dressers or even cabinets for clothing. No silverware, cups or glasses. Plenty of chairs on the beach for all guests and also grills. Make sure you don't accidentally take a wash cloth home, they do have a sign saying things are for sale and you will be charged. Rooms are kept clean. Overall it is a basic spot to stay on the beach for a few days, but there's nothing wrong with that, just don't expect entertainment here, just relaxation.",3
145,"Shopping trips to International Plaza can easily include the need to feed oneself due to the large scale layout of the retail center and its diverse dining options.

When a crowded, and sometimes noisy, food court won't fill the bill and you want to spend your valuable time shopping not waiting to be seated at a table and for an order to be taken, then this fun sushi place presents a great option.

Booths or seats at counters are equally accessible to the small bowls of hot and cold items that roll by providing tempting visuals of nicely presented food and ease of access to getting a bite right away. 

The dishes are not labeled so you can just be adventurous and help yourself to whatever catches your eye or you can try to match the descriptions and images printed on the menu to identify which passing dish suits you.

This is such a smart alternative to ordering only what you know you already like because you can expand your eating horizons for just a few more dollars per plate. There are lots of seafood, chicken, beef and vegetarian selections available to please anyone with specific preferences or dietary restrictions. Sadly, eel is not available at any of the YO! Sushi sites but everything was so fresh and tastily my disappointment over that omission was fleeting.

I like the speed, convenience and smoothness of this operation. I can sit down and have as much, or as little, as I like or select from ready-to-eat small takeaway trays of select items that are good to go when you just can't stop to take a seat and eat.",4

149,"ROTTEN RALPHS IS TRULY ROTTEN

I have visited Rotten Ralph's several times in the past because I thought they always made margaritas well and I enjoyed their lobster bisque. The most recent experience however, was so dreadful that I'd never return. We came in and were pleasantly greeted. There was no room at the bar so we had to go upstairs. It was uncomfortably quiet upstairs but no biggie. We were greeted soon after we settled and our drink orders were taken. 2 margaritas and 2 waters were ordered w/o ice. The server returns with one water full of ice. We questioned it after he ran downstairs but. I could wait for my water. My friend had to move her car before 10 and we had set a 15 min timer for her to leave. That's how I knew the drinks were taking a long time. On her way out my friend stopped by the bar  to get someone's attention and to ask why it was taking so long since hardly anyone was there. She just decided to leave since she saw our drinks just starting to be made. We got our drinks at 10:03. 

While we waited for our food the server was hovering . I get that we were the only ones upstairs but where was this attention when we ordered our drinks? The food came and I had to ask for clean cutlery and my friend had to ask for ketchup for her fries. Being someone who has worked in the service industry, I feel like there are certain things you shouldn't have to ask for. He asks us, ""so do you want hot sauce too?"" I thought that was odd because what is the implication? We just want ketchup and clean spoons. He returns with a clean spoon and we have to remind him about the ketchup. I order a second margarita and the server comes back with a martini glass the size of a shot glass. Their glasses were already on the smaller side. I find it funny that he tried to quickly take away my friends margarita which she wasn't even done with so I wouldn't see the difference but I did and took a picture. He apologized and surprisingly quickly came back with the rest of my drink. He proceeds to do more hovering and eventually drops the bill. We payed when we were ready and the he informed us after seeing more than one method of payment that we would have to tell him how much we wanted on the cards. Why in the world would we not tell him that? We hand him the payment and I ask to speak with a manager and this is when things went downhill. 

I had every intention of paying for my meal and tipping my server accordingly. But what I didn't know was that the manager was going to add fuel to very slow burning fire. I honestly just wanted to inform him that despite such positive experiences I've had here, this was the poorest. I brought two of my friends here and as first timers they said they wouldn't return. (They had increased their prices last I had been there. I thought it was slightly unreasonable because I don't think anything about the quality had improved) I try and tell him first about how it took about 20 minutes for our drinks to come and he was immediately on the defense. He tells me that he is personally responsible for making the drinks and he knows for a fact it didn't take 20 minutes. He says ""I think you know margaritas aren't the easiest drink to make. It's not a quick pour like a beer; it's a cocktail"". Excuse me? I know how long it takes to make a margarita and I know a margarita is a cocktail. Mind you he tells me this after cutting me off and with a pompous attitude. I was quite shocked. So I proceed to tell him my intentions like I previously stated. (Maybe he thought I was trying to get money off the bill or something) I didn't want anything from him, I just wanted to inform him of the unusual experience so they could do something about. He wasn't getting it as he continued to be on the defense and take the stance that they were right so I was automatically wrong. I tell him sir I've already paid and he says he knows, he has my money already. It seemed to be a lost cause so I tell him that he doesn't seem to care about my opinion so he got dismissed. He threatens to call the police on me and I welcomed it. I haven't done anything wrong and we were about to leave anyway. Of course more words were exchanged and even my friends tried to chime in but you get the gist. Long story short, I left no tip, I will never return, I will constantly demote them to anyone who will hear me, the ""manager"" was rude, arrogant, impatient, irrational, and a poor representation of Rotten Ralph's and the reason why I will NEVER RETURN.ps. I'm sorry to the server who didn't get a tip at all but I was mad as hell for the low class treatment...and you were a bit weird.",1

My wife always opts for the spanakopita, my daughter goes Italian and my son always goes for the tried and tested chicken bites and fries. So what I'm saying is they can cater for my whole family and the good is plentiful, great tasting and very good value for the money. As a plus the owner is always friendly and welcoming just to make the meal that bit more special. For family meals or even larger groups this is a great choice!",4

156,"The cutest brunch spot!!! If you have the chance, sit outside on the patio. It's just so lovely on a nice sunny morning. 

Came here on a Saturday with the bf. we ordered a brunch special which came with french toast, scrambled eggs & 2 pieces of bacon. We also ordered the roast beef sandwich. The french toast was delicious! It almost reminded me of the bread pudding. The only problem... it wasn't big enough!!! If I wasn't being conservative I could have eaten that portion of french toast in 2 bites. Not joking. It was good but not sure if it was worth like $7. The roast beef sandwich however was AMAZING! Boar's head never gets old. There was also some kind of chutney in the sandwich which is what made it pretty tasty in my opinion. And the sandwich was only like $6 and came with fruit.

I arrived at 11pm off a flight, get told despite having a reservation the only room left is the hospitality suite, I get upstairs and there is not even a bed ready for me. I call housekeeping and they come quickly to move a love seat and stone/metal coffee table in order to pull down the Murphy bed. Was I expected to do this on my own? Meanwhile, I pull all the towels out and create a walking bridge throughout the room so I can stop wondering what all the carpet stains might be from. Gross. I spent the next 30 mins scrubbing the bathroom floor to see if any stains would come up from the flooring--no luck...more towels. There are no lights next to the bed--because let's be honest, no one should sleep in this room--and so of course I bruised my shin trying to get from the light switch to the bed. I guess I should be grateful I got a room given 3 other late night arrivals with reservations got moved off property. This is just disgusting though. Disappointing Marriott.",1

Some memorable moments of the worker... I get out to inspect the car and the lady had attitude. When I saw the receipt and questioned the up charge, she played dumb and said I had to ask the people behind the desk.

The evening was very well organized and had lots of fun things for kids of all ages.  There were jugglers, magician, stilt-walkers and holiday characters, plus balloon artists and face painters.

A talented 20-piece orchestra played Christmas standards and holiday songs with a singer leading the charge.  A perfected outfitted Santa (he may have been the real one!!) was lifted 30 feet in the air on a scissors jack wrapped like a chimney, as the huge main tree and other 'supporting' trees were beautifully lit.  To top off the fun, a fireworks show ended the evening as snowblowers tossed their crystals onto the heads of the audience. 
 
It was truly a fun evening capped by so many smiles on the faces of all that attended.",5
162,"So I bought a discount certificate and thought I'd try this place out since it featured deep dish pizza.  There's your set up.

When my wife and I pulled up, we immediately raised an eyebrow and started playing the ""what did this building use to be?"" game.  That's never a good sign since it shows that not much has been invested initially to create it's own identity.

The same was true for the interior.  The walls were practically bare save for a few ""Italian"" items thrown up on a shelf along the back wall.  The open space and low ceilings of the floor plan gave the impression that we were eating at a neighbor's house who has tried to convert  his basement into a pizza parlor.

Now to be fair, it's a new business so I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt if they don't quite have the revenue to invest into the decor, but at least a wall to offset the bar area from the main dining room would be something. 

So we were greeted by the hostess (she looked about 15) and asked if we would like a booster seat.

A booster seat?

We had our FOUR-MONTH old son in a car seat.  Sorry, he's not quite at booster seat age.

Okay, young restaurant, young staff.  I'm still on board (slightly).  Let's get to the food.  

They do have a decent wine list, but only Sock Top and Bud-Lite on draft. My wife's ""salad"" was just a bowl of seasoned raw vegetables, no lettuce.  We ordered a large deep dish.  Knowing it would take a while to make, we had a lot of time to observe the operation. I may be mistaken, but we only saw one POS for entering orders and paying bills. That can't be good on a busy night (which it was slowly turning into)  A woman who must be a/the manager did come over to ask how we were doing and comment on our baby, so that was a plus.

Then the pizza came.  The upper ring of crust was nearly burnt.  My wife and I each had a piece but ended up taking the rest home.  It was mediocre at best, but I was more looking forward to reheating it at home after adding my own seasonings to it. 

I'm not one to count a restaurant out so early on in its operation, but Capone's definitely has some growing pains to get though.  This seems like a nice place for the Fenton locals but knowing what I know, I would not make another trip out there (and I don't live very far away at all).  If they can drop a little more cash into the look (maybe more of a speakeasy motif, y'know really work the Capone/Prohibition angle?) of the place, even some candles on the tables would be a start, then they are headed in the right direction.

I'm willing to give them another shot because as we were leaving the meatballs the table beside us ordered looked really good, but not anytime soon. Perhaps when my son is old enough for that booster seat.",2
163,"If you're a Latino, you're best staying away from this place.
The lady that cut my hair was rude and very unprofessional.",1
164,"I went here last night after reading about their 30 cent wings on Tuesdays.  For those of you who are thinking it's going to be a great deal, think again.  There are catches.  1) You MUST dine-in, and if you're like me, you'll feel obligated to tip even if the service is bad.  2) You MUST order a drink.  I didn't want soda so I ended up paying $1.79 for my tap water.  After tip and drink, I ended up paying roughly 60 cents each for my 15 wings ($9.00).  The wings themselves are mediocre.  I didn't notice an abundance of meat on each wing as another reviewer mentioned.  There was a lot of sauce on each wing though so that was good.  Overall, pretty mediocre wings for a mediocre price.  Nothing special.  I didn't like being lured in for a 30 cent wing deal only to find out there are stipulations you must adhere to in order to get the deal.",3
165,"My favs at this place are their peach margaritas and their chocolate peanut butter fried dough dessert. Sooo good.

Its a great happening place to watch a hockey game too. 

Only cons I have experienced is when the staff say the ""blender is broken"" and that you feel like you are sitting in the road with a bunch of fumes when on their patio. lol. I wish they could have a rooftop patio like O2s!",3
166,"Excellent Burgers - High Quality Beef, Cheese, and Buns.  Fries are tasty as well.",5
167,"I live in the neighborhood and wanted to try this place, I had a long day at work and I needed to sit down but I really wanted a hot pizza.... Im totally sick of dominoes across the street, I needed some substance. 
My boyfriend and I sat down at the counter and had a glass of wine and watched the owner make our pizzas, we chatted with him and enjoyed the peaceful respite from the normal pizza joint feel. It was cozy and the pizzas were great (Im no expert but I m from philly, and I like a good pizza). The crusts were chewy and soft and flavorful, and the sauce was sweet and mild. 
I am very glad this restaurant is in the neighborhood!",5
168,"Great milkshakes, but slowwwwwwww service every time I've been in here.",3
169,Such good food options for fast food at a mall. The naan is fresh and the butter chicken is amazing!,4
170,"I purchased a batch of these cookies and some of the cookies contained sayings from someone else's order  (various orders). It made handing out the cookies kind of scary since I never knew what someone would get when they cracked one open (one of the sayings, for example, seemed to belong to a bachelorette party). I contacted the company about four times via both email and telephone with absolutely no response.",2
171,"Such a good place downtown for some Pho loving! Compared to other Chinatown pho places, Pho Hao has more space and better parking (ain't nobody want to walk around the streets in that part of town). Staff are always very attentive and quick to help.

They've got a fairly big menu, consisting of all your Vietnamese food faves (salad rolls, vermicelli bowls, pho, you name it). One of the things I really like here is that they have such a wide selection of pho combinations. I'm a tripe and tendon hater, so it's nice to be able to cater to what meats I like best. Try the flank, it's so tender and delicious! In terms of broth, it's very lightly flavoured here, making for the perfect base to add your sauces to.",4
172,"I was very disappointed with the dry cleaning services. I took my winter coat in to be cleaned after coffee was spilled on it. It has a belt on it with a metal clasp. Not only did the coat still smell like coffee when they returned it to me, but they also broke the metal clasp on the belt in the dry cleaning machine. When I asked what happened and for some resolution, the owner told me that I should have known that metal items can get damaged in the dry cleaning machine. Isn't that why we went to a so-called expert, so he could tell us what should and should not go into the machine? Regardless, the clasp was not fixable so after about 30 minutes of arguing (during which time his wife would not stop staring at me and giving me the evil eye), he finally agreed that he would shop around for another clasp to fix it, and I should give him a week. I came back a week later, and he informed me that he didn't find another clasp but that he instead ""fixed"" the one he had broken. This mostly consisted of him painting the chipped metal. The clasp no longer works like it used to, and they didn't even offer to refund the price of the cleaning (I had to ask to get the money back). I won't be returning.",1
173,"This small Italian eatery is located just off Magazine street in the lower, much lower Garden District. I was here with a group of 7 and we sampled the salads and pizza for the most part. The pizza for New Orleans was not terrible, but not particularly great either. The salads were at best ok. The service was disorganized and the staff appeared overwhelmed even though it was only half full.",2
174,"I've had better, but pretty good for a neighborhood sushi joint. I'll go back, sure. 

Roll menu fairly limited, but my guess is they'd accommodate most any request. Service was attentive and speedy. All staff was eager to please. Other reviewers are right: Service is thoughtful and attentive. 

I thought the rolls were all fine (Mariner, Rose #1, San Francisco), but nothing like ""aw damn!"" good. I really can't complain, except to be honest, I have had more memorable sushi. Still though, competent and perfectly acceptable. 

I never knew this was here, so I'm glad I found it. For a quick pop in for sushi near the house, this can't be beat.",3
175,"Literally the worst rental company in SB! I have a pretty high tolerance for awful rental companies, having lived in SB for 5 years and dealing with one scummy slum lord to the next but... This place should be ashamed to call themselves a rental management company.. If housing wasn't so hard to come by in SB, and people ACTUALLY had a choice instead of having their hand forced financially, I know this ""Co."" would be out of business.
I just recently was able to get off the hook of living in one of their rentals. The rental itself was nice and spacious (no problem with the property). 
My issues lay entirely with the rental company. First off, they are practically unreachable at all times. I called multiples times during different weekdays, and was never able to speak to my property manager. I think he maybe returned 1 call to me out of the countless messages left.  Secondly, when it came to having new roommates move in/out, they somehow lost our numerous roommate swap applications sent in! Then a few months later, acted surprised that the person who had applied many times (and told they had been approved) was residing in the apartment. 
I had a sketchy roommate move in, without Bartlein providing any kind of background. When this person did not pay rent for 2 months, I began to feel uncomfortable and provided an ultimatum for either moving out ASAP or providing owed rent and moving out at an agreed time. When I contacted Bartlein for help on this matter, they acted as if it was something they had never dealt with. I ended up paying to have the locks changed myself. I then paid to have 3 extra copies made so I could provide them to Bartlein to be up front about everything. One of their star employees told me that I would be responsible for a charge for them to make copies of the key. Seriously, these people are useless.
This brings me to the staff... Where do you find these people?! I hope future employers of Bartlein employees look at this yelp page. These employees are literally all awful. Everytime I went in, no one had any idea what was going on, everyone looked just as confused (if not more confused) than I was. Never had any problems solved by going into their office.
Needless to say, I am relieved and grateful for having moved out. Of course Bartlein kept 2/3 of my security deposit (charging me to repair broken stove, garbage disposal) that they themselves had no fixed, even after I put in multiple service requests. Honestly, losing all that money was painful, but I am okay knowing I flushed over $1600 down the toilet, but no longer have to deal with Bartlein ever again.
If you're reading this and considering renting from them, listen to allllll of these reviews! It's not worth it!",1
176,"Inconsistent...WE were so excited to try this lovely, atmospheric restaurant.  The setting and our waiter were wonderful BUT our food (overall) batted about 50%.  The hamburger was terrific; one dish with pork tenderloin was great ...but the ""Ways and Means"" dish was not good ...and the fries (served with the hamburger) were cold.  The cheese plate appetizer was disappointing...old grapes and very little fruit...(way too skimpy)...  The bread pudding was very good...the custard was cold-refrigerated... and only fair.  Gosh ... this restaurant COULD be great!!!  But...we were disappointed....",3
177,"I cannot believe an almost-terrific bbq place is finally here in Horsham.  Hurrah!

Nice staff, clean look to the place.  

Oh yeah, to start, the bbq smells INCREDIBLE on the way-in from the parking lot!

Brisket is lean and not chewy!  Chicken tenders tasty, pork, delicious.  BBQ chicken a bit ""hot"" but yummy.  Sandwiches perfect.  All the main meat dishes are WONDERFUL!

Just avoid the sides.  French fries were soggy, corn on the cob was yucky and brown and dry.  Garlic mashed potatoes not only thin and salty and totally from a box, but we found pieces of foil in it.  Mac-n-cheese also thin and tasteless.  Do not order the sides.

Also, (for take-out) there is (almost) no sauce on the sandwiches; you have to (know to) get your own from a side-bar of various, wonderful bbq sauces. 

Overall, thumbs up!  Great main courses, just avoid the sides.  We go to BBQ BBQ all the time!!",4
178,"Our intention was to go to Rooster.. but the wait at noon on a Sunday was 45 minutes.. crazy. So I pulled out Yelp to see what other downtown options I have and it suggested Blondie's. I love the laid back attitude and funky furniture. Boyfriend had a bagel and cream cheese and a blueberry pancake off the kids menu. He enjoyed himself.. I had the banana french toast.. very good but very sweet.. I think I would have enjoyed this as a half order and had something savory as well. 
Loved the bottle service for mimosa's. Had a $25 bottle of champagne and unlimited orange juice (great juice!). We will be back for sure!",4
179,We went for lunch on Saturday.  They only serve from a brunch menu.  It was very disappointing.  They really need to re-think the brunch menu and serve items from their good at.  I never had dinner her although I would assume it is better than the brunch items.  I had the meatball omelette which was just ok.  I would say anywhere else would have better omelets. My husband had the burger with an egg on it.  He thought it was good but there are better burgers out there.  I should have went with my gut instinct after seeing the brunch menu but decided to stay since it was Joe Madden's restaurant.  I say skip this place and go down the street to Goody Goody.,1
180,"Wonderful outdoor experience. Mingle w/ friends & strangers, listening  to cool jazz on a hot summer's eve while sipping on a wide selection of good wines & sampling an extensive selection of cheese, meats & accompaniments. What could be more enjoyable?",4
181,"Quality of this store has gone downhill over the past few years. In the past,  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh, but more expensive,  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on.",1
182,"The only positive about this franchise location is how new it is. The food, while still pretty good, was not up to the standard we have become accustom to at other Red Robin restaurants. While we were seated relatively quickly that was where the service ended. We were ready for drink refills while waiting for our waitress to return to take our food order... For some strange reason the wait staff at this location does not clear the table as food and drink is finished. Instead they leave everything on the table until after you leave when a busboy clears everything. It was a little challenging to keep young children entertained with a massive pile of dishes and glasses in the middle of the table.",2
183,"The location is the only positive thing about this restaurant. It is located right on the boardwalk. There are great views of the water. We did see dolphins while waiting.
I ordered the grouper sandwich and it came on a stale bun, wilted lettuce and tomato. The grouper was over cooked and rubbery. My daughter ordered the crab cake sandwich. The bun was also stale. She said she felt ill about an hour after eating the dinner. 
Service lacked as well. Nobody would seat us and the wait staff was not friendly at all. What a horrible experience.... Do not eat there!!!!!!",1
184,"Tonic, tonic tonic. I will admit I used to go here a lot in my college days. I was at UCSB when this place first opened. It was a great alternative if you wanted a nice club/bar to go to...sometimes Madison's and Sharkees just got old.  The drinks are a little pricier but worth it for the ambiance.  When I went there it was a hot spot for all the sorority girls - not sure if that is still the case but anyway...

check it out if you are out and about during Thursday night college downtown.",3

186,"Had dinner at Marti's for the 5th time in 4 months and it was delicious once again. Their food speaks for itself and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is beyond all expectations! The weekend hostess (We are usually there on the weekend) Lauren greets everyone by name and is so gracious. Our server, Joe is extremely attentive and friendly and makes wonderful suggestions. The General Manager, Chris, is in the dining room during service and talks with each table. He also makes a point to know your name and shake your hand. We had the pleasure of meeting Chef Drew on our last visit. Awesome young chef! I can't wait to see what he is planning for the Fall Menu! Marti's is our favorite restaurant in the Quarter!",5
187,"Mediocre food, decent service.  Excellent fountain Coke.  My advice: If you have to eat here, use the salsa (which was way too sweet) to add some flavor to the rest of your meal.

I was amazed by how many restaurants are in this shopping center... the fact that Estela's is still in business is bad commentary on the rest of them",2
188,"Overpriced, food just okay. Very small basket of chips and they charge for more...even if you buy the $4 queso and beef. Charges for sharing, too. Not impressed and won't return.",2
189,"Maybe I should not have expected much from a sushi joint in Nashville. I mean, really, it's as if i'd been let down because a cuban restaurant didn't live up to my Miami standards. I didn't come to Nashville to eat sushi, but I really craved it while I was in town and my girlfriend who was showing us around said she'd been there a long time ago and remembered that it was a buffet-style place in a great location.

Done deal. We get there, and she was right about the area. The food was quite underwhelming. Nothing tasted very fresh. In fact, everything I got from the sushi buffet was soggy and maybe even slightly warm (not good for uncooked food). They do have a small sake selection of sake of which we enjoyed an unfiltered bottle of. The price for 3 people eating from the buffet, 1 small bottle of sake and 1 Sapporro came out to just over $70.

Not a place I'd look forward to going to again. I wish I could give it a better review and rating!!!",1
190,Food was amazing! We went for a Father's Day Brunch and the two-course meal was sensational! I ordered the Veggie Cobb Salad and the Breakfast Burrito. Our waitress was very responsive and came regularly to check on us.,5
191,"If you are in Indian Rocks Beach I strongly recommend dining at JDs.  The food is excellent, service outstanding, and the atmosphere relaxed.  During the past week we dined twice at JDs - once for breakfast and a dinner meal.  The breakfast was well prepared and really reasonable priced.  This evening (Thursday) the entire family dined on a $5 steak (5 oz) each that was truly tasty and filling!  Thursdays is $5 steak night at  JDs.  You can't beat the dining experience and the price.",5
192,"Strong coffee, 10x better than Starbucks and cheaper, vegan jewish apple cake is awesome. Gluten free items too. Funky! Never more than a one minute line. I go multiple times per week.",5
193,Just personal preference i guess but there was too much sauce so it was all goopy and too overpowering of a flavour. .,2
194,"Went here in January and it was great . The meal included a salad . Went back in Feb. and got charged about $20 EXTRA for our 2 salads ! That is a huge price increase . You are better off to go to Sperry,s who gives you a huge salad bar with the meal for free . Don't ever order the 3 filet meal here . The 3 filets are about the size of 3 pieces of cut up stew beef cubes . Apparently , this is now a very price driven over-priced eating spot. Too bad .",2
195,"Just meh ramen, having people wait outside in line, in the sun, is in fact a stupid idea (even though management was so petty they put a sign on the door stating it's not a dumb idea). The wait staff sucked, couldn't get a refill on drinks the entire time we were there, and the server told me not to use Sriracha or I would ruin my meal, kid please, I know what I like, if I want Sriracha give me the dang sauce. Overall just a crappy restaurant, only reason it will stay in business is the hipsters.",1
196,Not that bad at all. The facility has been remodeled and looks very fancy and welcoming. They removed the previous plexi bullet proof glass windows which is great. That makes the place look less aggressive. Service was abnormal acceptable speed to return cable equipment. Overall not bad at all.,4
197,"Only ordered there pizza but man is it salty and just plain. Lack of toppings doesn't help but the crust is cardboard. New to area I just want a good pizza but for anyone new to Port Richey area there's no such thing. 
Not good tasting and not good visually.",2
198,"Definitely some good deals here and the occasional wow did I just find that for only 20$( 10$) etc item, however items are rung up at the wrong price often. And I don't mean, oh I thought that was the sale color but it's not, I mean on the tag it says 5.99 but your receipt says 8.99. Check any electronic equipment fully, not that it just powers on, if you can. They do not make sure a CD player does play or item does more than turn on but sell it anyway. They also sell online computer games that you have to enter a code for, once those have been used only the owner can play it so if you buy it used you can't use it, ever. No way to transfer it, literally buying a game you could never play. Since you can't return anything, important to know. Lots of things but buy cautiously.",3
199,"Dangerous.  They are OK with life endangering, lazy repairs.  My wife insists on taking her Saturn there because they used to be a Saturn dealer.  She recently bought a new set of overpriced tires and these pitiful pukes did not put in new valve stems.  Down to about 13 psi by the time she got home.  The worst.  She took my truck there for a surprise gift oil change once which I really appreciated until SURPRISE, oil all over the garage due to finger tight plug.  Buffoons",1
200,"I am a ridiculously huge fan of taco bell, in the sense that I could eat it for lunch almost every day and then go back for dinner.  This particular taco bell is the worst i have ever, ever been to.    The wait times are just outragous, whether in store or in the drive-through.  I dont know if it is the staff, or lack of management, or both combined, but something definitely needs to be changed at this location.  I will say this is the first time in about the 50+ times i have been there that my order was completely correct.  But hell, it should have been considering i was there for 25 minutes or more.  I should not be able to go to a sit down restaurant and potentially get my food quicker than i would through this fast food joint.",2
201,"Found this place bc of the high rating on Yelp but sad to say I was disappointed .  They told us the wait would be about 20 min but waited closer to 45 - bonus points bc you can check to see where you stand in the wait list.

We got the hash which had little flavor but what seemed like a spicy mayo (not the delicious kind at w sushi) and was supposed to have other mixins but was primarily just potatoes.  

We also tried the avocado toast but it was just mediocre (I promise I'm not a picky eater!) I will say the biscuits were fantastic and I basically ate just that alone.

The staff was super friendly and the ambiance was cool but I think I could go without visiting again",3
202,"Great little sports bar with cool games like ski ball, basketball, hockey, and darts. I got a mixed drink that was served in way too small a glass tho :( Pretty nice beer selection tho :) Big seating area in other room and a nice roomy outside patio/deck, but the view is of train tracks but whatevs",4
203,Despite the name this place doesn't come close to any of the NYC pizzerias I've tried. Of course not many cities have pies of the quality served in NYC-problem is they don't come close to the other top local places either. To be positive it's not bad pizza just nothing special. Somewhat disinterested service at the bar the one time I went even though the place was empty. I'll give it another at some point-maybe.,3
204,AMAZING! The shrimp 4 way platter was SO GOOD! All 4 ways delicious but my fave was the coconut shrimp. I'm already addicted to the coconut rice. The service was fabulous! Josh did a great job! We went yesterday for lunch and plan on going back tonight for dinner. I can't wait to try something new and the key lime pie! Award winning!! Yum!,5

208,"So I came here pretty darn excited to come here being that the restarurant combines two of my most favorite things in the world...whiskey and burgers. I couldn't wait to try the Village Burger being that I've heard it's one of the best in Philly.

When my friend and I got there around 7:30pm we were told that there would be at least a 30 minute wait to eat inside but that we could eat at the full-service bar or outside. It was a Monday, and either way it didn't bother us as the evening was nice and I always enjoy a good outdoor meal.

Once seated we both couldn't get over how uncomfortable our waitress seemed. It might've been the case that she was new and getting the hang of things on what was supposed to be a slow Monday night, but regardless it was all too noticeable how awkward she seemed when taking our order and performing other tasks like cleaning our plates/refilling drinks. I ordered whiskey and my friend got beer, and she asked us what we wanted to drink next when we were both clearly barely halfway through our drinks. She also felt the need to pour us water in our glasses when they were definitely still 3/4 or more of the way filled. I just didn't see all that as necessary and it detracted from the experience.

The burger itself was delicious I will say, but overpriced. I'm not in any rush to come back here for a burger to be sure. Each topping outside of lettuce is at least $2 extra or more. So the price of a medium-sized burger easily balloons to about $18...and that doesn't even include the $5 Duck Fat fries that any diner would typically want as well.

I would say that the hype was a little extreme on this place for me and I know of other places in Philly that serve a solid burger without all the extra frill.",3
209,"Two words, FALAFEL BUFFET.  I know that also sounds like thunder thighs buffet, but hey, some buffets you just have to try. Every Saturday there's an Iranian/Mediteranian buffet.  Falafel, Kabob, sometimes curry, Its awesome. During weekdays the food is always cooked and seasoned wonderfully and its a great experience every time. 

This family owned restaurant is such a good addition to our community.  Its hard to find a restaurant where you have contact with the owners in every experience. This place measures up as they have several times made special orders for me and comped delicious soups and appetizers. 

Its a must try for all Reno-ites.",4

212,Stopped in to check out their offerings of file cabinets and was very surprised by the amount of furniture available and the very reasonable prices.  I'm not much of a thrift store shopper - actually the whole idea kinda creeps me out - but their prices were really great and they had some pieces that could be fabulous with a coat of paint or new fabric!  Didn't find said file cabinet but I'm sure we will be back to peruse on another occasion.,3
213,I found this place Thanks to a coupon in my book tried it loved the food but the servise was awful the first time then I went in today and the service was 10 times better and who ever was running the register defiantly had her crew together and the food is amazing best sub shop I have had here :),5
214,I must say I was very disappointed I read the reviews and I had high hopes but I would not go back. I ordered 1/2 slab and 1/2bl of the brisket. When I got home to eat the ribs were so burnt that were bitter and impossible to eat. The brisket looked ok but had absolutely no flavor what so ever. I gave it one star for the service which are nice guys but my food was not what to expect,1
215,Their tacos suck and really long wait for food which doesn't make sense to me because the meat taste like it was cooked last month and stored in the freezer. That being said they have a nice ambiance and the staff is really nice.,2
216,"Every year we purchase multiple gift cards for Brio as mother's day presents. We have been doing this for years. The last two times I have been to this Brio to purchase gift cards or have lunch, I have stood at the counter and been ignored as multiple employees have either walked past or helped people that have come in after me. Today I told the host what had happened and he laughed. Their food is decent. Their service leaves a lot to be desired. I would not recommend going to this Brio, especially when there are numerous options in the same plaza with great food and service.",1
217,Healthy and delicious! Order is ready quickly and they are always friendly. One of my favorite go-to lunch spots in South Tampa.,5

219,"Like the 2 stars on Yelp say... ""meh, I've experienced better"" - yep.

Although the service was pretty good and the dishes came out promptly, the food wasn't all that great.

The lunch started out with a house soup (your usual ""leftovers"" soup - bamboo shoots, tofu, sprouts - whatever else is left over from yesterday thrown in a pot) - meh. 

Fresh Rolls - I've had much better. Lettuce, sprouts, and a bit o' shrimp in some rice paper rolls. 

Spicy Chicken Fried Rice - Wasn't all that great... the weird part was that it had a sweaty kinda look to it - moist, maybe? The taste was okay and the portions were large... but ehh...

My friends both had the pad kra prow - and both said it was bland. Not a very good way to describe food. 

Well... I guess we should've known when we arrived to a pretty empty restaurant right in the middle of lunch hour. Didn't get much better throughout the lunch hour, either. Whatever... 

Definite skipper in my opinion... I'd rather go to Chiang Mai",2
220,"Bought a set of Cooper tires for my Jeep Liberty that had a 60,000 mile  warranty from Reno Vulc 3 years ago. Rotated, balanced and had alignments done as required. Tires needed replacing at 28,000 miles. Cooper tires put up a fuss because the worn out tires didn't fall within their replacement guidelines. Reno Vulc stepped up and gave me a great prorated credit on a set of new Wrangler tires. Bottom line: Reno Vulc rocks; Cooper tires SUCK. Would NEVER buy another Cooper tire!",5
221,"MMMM breakfast. I love it. I love everything about it. And Ghini's (for the most part) didn't disappoint. 

This morning I had a sort of ""create your own combo"". I did two scrambled eggs with chopped up basil folded in, hash-browns, and biscuits with apricot jam. The eggs were incredible! Fluffy yet firm, but not overcooked. The basil was a perfect addition to fill out the flavor of otherwise bland eggs. The biscuits were pretty much out of this world. I'm going to say they were the best biscuits I've ever had. And the jam?! Oh the jam. Don't even get me started! The hash-browns on the other hand feel short. Not much flavor, soft, and sort of cold. I asked for them well done, but that didn't really happen, and that bummed me out a little. 

Service was a little off too. It was busy- CRAZY busy, so I imagine they were strapped to get people seated and get food in their mouths timely, but I had to wait a little longer for a server to come over. Once he took my order though everything moved along like clock work. And so I'll hit em up again, it was breakfast well done. And next time I'll make sure the hash-browns are well done too!",4
222,"Ate here tonight with a girlfriend and my daughter.
Our waiter was nice but dumb as they come.
Could not understand him when he spoke..he mumbled. Asked for 3 glasses of wine and glass of ice.. no ice..had to ask bus boy. Waiter says I'm sorry! Asked what the soup was.He said i shoukd know that one..but I don't..I'm sorry! Ordered food and he delivered tortellini instead of gnocchi. Returned and had to wait 20 min..aHe said..thats my fault..I'm sorry! 
My daughter is 31 yrs old..not a child and she is very educated woman. She ordered a gnocchi dish described as spicy hot garlic sauce..Gnocchi Feliciano I believe was the name. Soooooooo spicy hot it tasted like hot tobacco sauce..First bite your lips and tongue were burning and you could not even taste the food.. it was not edible at all..
We sent it back and asked for it to be removed from the bill.
Female manager with long dark hair and glasses came to our table and said the chef said not to take off the bill because it said spicy hot..I said spicy hot was not the issue..It was unnaturally HOT. You couldn't even taste the food. It was nauseating. She argued and I said I am NOT paying for something I can't eat because it has no taste...just Hot and Burning.
The waiter said we were the 2nd customer tonight to complain about the same thing..
She ruined our dinner..my girlfriend and I both lost our appetite and my daughter has been sick to her stomach since we left the restaurant..
I said to the manager.. Just cause it describes something as being spicy..yet you cannot taste anything because it is too hot and you cannot eat it should have made her come over to us and APOLOGIZE...NOT ARGUE WITH US!! Will NEVER RETURN!!!!
Terrible customer service..Terrible Food! 
Chef and Management should be embarrassed and Owners should pay better attention to the way  customers are talked to.

223,"Service was great! Here on business, and made my last stop here for dinner. The shrimp marinara with angel hair --- yummy!! So was the shrimp linguine with Alfredo. Thumbs up :)",5
224,"Excellent, excellent food. Beautiful decor. Service was very poor.
I had the lobster ravioli and it was different then any other, but near mouth watering. I finished the plate. She had the Cesar salad and salmon which was excellent!
As I mentioned the service as ""catch as you can"" with waiter's walking right by you with a full water pitcher yet not filling your empty glass. We had to flag down a person to order.
I would easily eat there again. And be prepared for ho-hum service.
With a snap and intuitive service team I would have given this place 4+ to 5-star. But as it is, 4-star is high s she goes.",4
225,"We were looking forward to dining here and made reservations only to wait over an hour.  We were disappointed.  The waitress wasn't very helpful with helping us order from the menu, which is in French.  She seemed arrogant.  Owners seem like awesome people.  We loved and miss the Bleubird cafe.",3
226,"Outstanding service, food and drinks.  The Mojitos, Cava Martinis and Espresso Martini are unbelievable.   The food is beautifully prepared and delicious!  The prices are so reasonable and the staff will do anything to make your experience perfect.
The food is definitely a blend of Spanish, Mexican and other Latin American cuisines.
On our trip to Mussel Shoals we made the drive to Cava twice.   Bravísimo!",5
227,"This is the best place in this entire area for breakfast we will come here over and over again 
Service is amazing 
Food is great 
The portion sizes for your buck are unbeatable 
Keep up the good work Cracker Barrel we love you",5
228,I had my 40th bday party here and what a great night! The staff treated me like gold and even made me a cake. The helped all my friends and treated us soooo well. The drinks were yummy. I love that there is no smoking inside. I love that they have games to play. I also love the lounge that is in the next building over. They have been nice to us when we went there before too. I would highly recommend you come here for a great time and great service. Nice open place as well.,5
229,"The customer service was great. Only rating this place 4/5 stars because the pita was a bit hard, which made it difficult to chew, and the setting was a bit crowded (which they obviously can't help)! But a nice thing is they deliver or you can get pick up. The smoothie was SOO good. Also, you can tell falafel sandwich had fresh ingredients! And the portion definitely met the cost. I would order from here again!",4
230,Baileys' Range is definitely worth a shot. It has a nice open feel to it (although when we went it was kinda hot upstairs). The drink menu was fun and all of the beers are from local breweries. I don't eat that much red meat so originally I was going to go with a chicken selection. I am glad I went with my choice...the LGBT. SO GOOD! I thought the portion was perfect and I think the prices are good. I shared the fries with someone and got the rooster sauce. Everything was really good and our server was great. I will be coming back and would suggest anyone visiting to check it out as well!,4
231,"Still on the hunt for a BBQ joint.  

The smoking pit in the yard drew me into this establishments and at once repulsed me.  Cooking outside is a violation because the product is not protected from environmental contamination.

The kitchen it self seemed to be messy and the cook was preoccupied in the preparation area to notice i was watching as he scratched himself.  The restroom was not well kept.  This was surprising as the was an over abundance of female staff.  

The establishment was big and empty.  We sat at the bar. I watched as waitress/bartender twirled her dirty fingers in the salt/sugar plates.  

One of the most off putting things was the waitress hovering waiting for us to sign the bill the immediately taking the signed receipt.  

The food was nothing to write home about.  The meat was smokey that is about all I have to say about it.   I also tried the layered bowl with was greasy and gave me indigestion.  My husband had the nachos with the BBQ pork, again it was just ok.",2
232,"I went to dinner at Cafe Eau earlier this week and was not impressed by the food or the service. My friend and I decided to split the beef quesadilla appetizers and 10 minutes later the server brought out an appetizer platter instead - she looked like she was going to walk away before we spoke up about receiving the wrong order. Then she confessed that she typed in the wrong order and didn't have the heart to tell the kitchen. We ended up keeping the appetizer platter but only paying what we would have for the beef quesadilla. Nothing on the platter was spectacular or really even all that good. The meat in the pork pot stickers were grainy, the toasted ravioli was a lot of breading and not much filling and the buffalo chicken bites were just mediocre. 

I ordered a chicken Caesar salad for dinner while my friend ordered the fried tenderloin. My salad was OK and his beef was just OK as well (i thought the beef had a funny texture to it, almost like it had been steamed)...nothing to write home about. We asked for the check and the server gave it to us, only to come back 3 minutes later with the correct bill (she had handed us another table's check). 

Overall I wouldn't come back here to eat, I think i might come back for a couple of drinks at the bar. I just don think that the food is worth the price you pay for it.",2
233,"Snooty, noisy and expensive. Food is ok and location is good but the staff are snobs ( hard to fathom why ) and the acoustics make for uncomfortable l veld of noise.

Not with it.",2
234,"Just experienced probably the greatest tacos that I've ever tasted. The cashier was wonderful and gave me her recommendations which I followed The fish taco was so fresh and so delicious and complemented by the sauces provided, I literally sat there in a state of amazement. My second taco was the Carnita. Usually braised pork loses its flavor. Here it not only maintained its flavor, it was picked by the spices and accompaniments. Also, the other sauce provided on the table just took this to unbelievable Heights. I highly, highly recommend this restaurant",5
235,Clean store rarely crowded. Well maintained and stocked. Store Assoc here are  friendly and helpful. The store is big enough to have variety but not so large that it overwhelms you or has 25 different kinds of table salt.. The only thing that keeps me from been a regular are the prices could be better.,3
236,"This Nail salon is awesome!!! I made an appointment for me and a friend. The entire time we were getting our nails done, we were the only customers, which was great. They do accept walk ins, but the gentlemen suggested to always make an appointment.  The gentlemen who did my nails was excellent, he took his time, he was very patient, and paid attention to detail.  The women who did my friends nails, did a good job as well. My friends nails looked great. The salon has free wifi, I was offered water, and the gentlemen offered to put a movie on. I will definitely be coming back, and I would recommend this salon. !",5
237,"The food here was fantastic. Chicken 65 and the dosas were delicious. I hope more people come here. It isn't the fanciest of places, but it is very endearing. I hope they are successful bringing authentic Indian food to Nashville.",5
238,"I have visited here a few times for pedicures but I think I will start looking for a new place. Being new to Edmonton this was the first nail place I visited, and once I find a place I tend to stick with it out of comfort. My pedicures have always looked good but it is expensive ($70 for shellac with the ""spa"" treatment, which consists of them VERY briefly rubbing exfoliant and cooling gel on your feet and legs). The last time I went, I watched closely as I have started hearing more on the news about  unsanitary conditions present in some nail salons. Tools came out of plastic packages (presumably autoclaved) but were dumped directly onto the metal cart which I can only assume isn't cleaned between patrons. She took out a fresh wooden stick to put the exfoliant and cooling gel on my legs, but double dipped many times and I assume that wasn't just with me. There were people coming in steadily that day, and the woman doing my pedi kept her eyes on the door literally 95% of the time and would stop working on me to yell across the room every time someone came in to find out what service they wanted. I don't know if she was doubling as manager that day or what. She was very distracted though. For the exfoliant part, she only did one foot!! She also didn't trim the cuticles on one of my feet, but went back later on - maybe she remembered she forgot. Yes, I should have spoke up about the missed services and potential health hazards - this was my error. But overall I think this was the last straw so I will now find a new salon.",2
239,"I came here for a Sunday lunch. Didn't expect much, since it always seems touristy. If you want reheated frozen food, this is your place. Decor is not good, food is not good. Boo. Bathroom was clean. That's earns it A star.

Poor tourists! If they come to Philly and come here, they are getting a very poor representation of what Philly has to offer in dining. Very poor, indeed! Take a picture of the mural and keep walking. There are many, many better places on South St. and around the corners on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th streets.",1
240,I have read some of the other reviews and should have read them before trying this place.  Eating should be enjoyable.  I have started eating at Jade Garden at Hillsborough and Habana.  Definitely worth the drive to get some quality Chinese food.,1
241,"The food is good, but the service is horrible. We ordered four different meals at the same time and they were served and completed at completely different times. Unacceptable",2
242,"Great drinks, service was on time with complimentary ice cream on the house before we left. Bombay misbehavior is a MUST TRY drink.",4
243,"Quick shout outs - our server, Jordan, worked really hard to make our meal enjoyable.  He was prompt and responsive and my family and I really appreciated his effort.

Now to the review - the food was pretty good, when it came out correct...We are vegetarian and ordered the Brussel sprouts (without bacon), two pizzas (margharita and potato) and one pasta (arrabiata).  When the person brought the Brussel sprouts to the table, she said there was no meat...but in my first bite I had a piece of bacon. Definitely disappointed from that experience.  Luckily they paid extra attention to the rest of our order and made sure everything was correct.  I think the kitchen at this place is very overwhelmed...

This actually leads to the main reason for the 2-star review.  We made a reservation for 6 at 7:30p.  When we got there at 7:25p they told us that the had 2 other parties of 6 that needed to be seated before us and the kitchen was running behind.  We said that we had a reservation but apparently so did the other parties.  Why in the world would they book three reservations at the same time when they clearly didn't have the space/ability to accommodate?! We heard similar comments about why even make a reservation from most of the people waiting in the waiting area.  When we finally got seated...30 mins after our reservation...it was at a make shift table that was extremely tight without sufficient space for all our plates. 

The food was the redeeming quality for my experience.  My brother said that he had a similar experience the last time he came here for dinner.  Eventually the negative experience is going to outweigh the quality of food...and I feel that's going to happen pretty quick. They need to figure something out to turn around the service, and fast.",2
244,"Walked in and sat down. Some tall skinny bartender gave attitude. I got up and walked out.
If the manager is reading this that dude lost you money.",1
245,"Haven't actually BEEN to the shop yet so there's that.  Definitely will though.

Just took Lucy's IMBA level 1 instructional class yesterday.  The class was totally awesome and perfect. Lucy and Kevin were perfect instructors for an elderly MTB beginner. Cannot recommend the class highly enough. Awesome day at Alafia.  Great riding.

Can't wait to go back.

Kevin and Lucy are totally freaking awesome.

Peace.",5
246,"This was my first visit to 3 Sisters Cafe and I was not disappointed. I had just come out of a physical therapy appointment for my spouse down the road at Athletico and wanted a tasty, fast breakfast -- with FAST being the operative word here. 

I took a chance on 3 Sisters and it really paid off. We were in and out of there with great service in about 35 minutes total. It's a small place with friendly servers. I had a classic breakfast: 2 eggs, toast, and bacon. This was called ""The Don"" and came with potatoes but they swapped the taters for bacon at no additional cost. What an unexpected surprise! Everything was cooked to perfection: eggs over medium, wheat toast perfectly toasted, and crispy bacon. 

My husband ordered a ""half"" order of pancakes which was a single giant pancake that took up literally the entire platter. He also had a side order of eggs. The portions were so generous that he wasn't able to finish it all despite having just worked up an appetite from the physical therapy. 

The only thing I wish I could change is the acoustics in the place. I love that it's a converted old cottage house, but the echoes of nearby diners is pretty disruptive. There were only 4 groups of people counting us and it was pretty loud. We considered moving to their nice outdoor dining area but it's 85 and humid so we stayed put. 

I'll definitely be back with friends!",4
247,"As far as gay bars go, this place is the tits!

Aesthetically speaking, a gay sports bar is a genius concept.  Finally, someone has combined the latent homoeroticism of professional athletics with actual homoeroticism.  It was a long time coming, but I hope it will inspire many more.

The general vibe of the place is wonderful.  It sports an all-around friendly atmosphere, whether you are gay or straight.  The staff is friendly, the customers are non-douchey, and the drinks are wet.  What more do you want?",4
248,"Walked into the restaurant, with reservations, and many open tables.  I asked the manager for a window table and was responded with ""they are all reserved.""  Two hours later, when we left, still many open tables next to the windows.

Overall food was good.
I had the filet and she had the salmon.
The bottle of wine that was recommended was $75 and was not told prior to ordering it, just that it was the last bottle.",2
249,"Ooh, I kind of love this place. I've only been there once so I can only vouch for the bartender we had but it was a great time. It was pretty empty when we walked in, got some cheap beers and shots and checked the place out. The bartender ended up telling us about some crazy random string of incidents that had happened about 5 minutes before we walked in. I won't bore with the details, but it was a hilarious story and I was not surprised at all to hear that these sort of things happen at the Saint. 

Great jukebox with Screeching Weasel and tons of other stuff I haven't listened to in about ten years. Photo booth, centipede/milipede, table seating, comfortable bar to sit at, lots of cool crap to look at on the walls. Will definitely go back.",5
250,"Supposedly, this is the joint where the Ruth of Ruth's Chris learned this now infamous formula....

Butter + Sizzling Steak = Ooh La La

Their steaks are divine, my filet was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of butter.  The potatoes au gratin makes my want to join carbaholics anonymous.  The service is sweet and personable....leave the hoitty-toittiness at Ruth's Chris.",4
251,"This is my fourth visit.   It's much improved from our first visit but still not yummy.  The brisket, while not petrified, was still dry and chewy.  I'm not sure whether the bun was stale or just not to my liking.  It was kinda dry too but that might be the way its supposed to be.  I liked the mashed potato side.  Fairly garlicky.   Coleslaw too saucy for me but not bad. In general, I love brisket on a bun....but here it's .....passable.  Not something to make a point of coming out for.",2
252,"The service was warm and friendly. The food was good, but felt heavy on the fried chips, and had a processed food feel. There is no way this place should be number one on Yelp Philadelphia restaurants.

The best chaats in Philly might be at Indeblue.   Or tiffin bistro.  Or high end Tashan.

Good food here, not great, middle of the pack.",2
253,20 minute wait for the shuttle (in the middle of a Saturday) then a 37 minute wait in line to check in for the car. Complete lack of urgency on behalf of the staff and indifferent to the long wait time. Car was clean and they had a good selection of vehicles.,1
254,"The lunch buffet is good and set at a reasonable price for the selection, especially the made to order pasta. The happy hour appetizers are also tasty and the happy hour drink prices are a little high, but not bad. Unfortunately, the service is usually lacking in friendliness, accessibility, and just plain being nice; on my last two visits the waiters were really rather rude and kind of snooty.",3
255,"A solid B to B+. I tried the falafel plate, which came with rice and a small salad, as well as a few slices of pita bread. The falafel had a nice subtle flavor; not overpowering but definitely not bland. I tend to prefer my falafel's inside consistency a little less dense, if that's the right description, but it was a nice flavor and a good cook for a nice crunchy outside. The rice was cooked perfectly (I can't stand an overlooked mushy rice) but didn't have a whole lot of flavor. It was light and refreshing, but not spectacular. The drizzle over the top (tahini? laban?) was a nice addition. Overall very nice food, a solid B-B+.",4
256,"Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.",1
257,"I love Jet's, but I'm saying goodbye to this location. I've ordered from this location once a week for a year and this places continues to go down hill. I have not had even a semi-warm pizza delivered from this Jet's location.

2 hour delivery times every time I call. I've even tried calling earlier in the day to schedule a delivery time that they guarantee for that evening, but they're still over an hour late. The drivers overly apologize and state each time that it's the management that won't hire more drivers.

I am just now speaking up because all fingers seem to point to the management that does not seem to care.",1
258,"I didn't end up buying a car from here (or anywhere) simply due to a paperwork mess up on the car I wanted, but I will in the future. I've worked extensively with Jinal via email and telephone and he has been more than friendly as well as personable. 

I normally hate dealing with any type of sales whether I buy a car or a computer. I'm the type that just want to say ""I want X, Y and Z "" and be done with it. Jinal left me feeling that there wasn't going to be any hassle, dishonesty or games. It was straight to the point. Just how I like it.

I'll be picking up a new Audi sometime within a year or so and when I do, it will be from here!",4
259,Cashier Dianna was horrible. She informed us there's only one size cup of coffee when right in front of her there was two sizes. Customers waited 15mins plus for their orders some leaving to make their flight. Their purchased food was given to other customers. Cashier Dianna expressed there were no cheesecake or bagels although the display windows had items prepared. The professionalism was far less then adequate. A true disappointment.,1
260,"The pizza here is hand tossed and delicious. 

We got two pies for dinner: The Lasagna Pizza and a standard pepperoni & mushroom. In addition, I got the antipasto salad. 
First up the salad: the size was great and the toppings of salami, pepperoni, cheese, sun dried tomatoes, and roasted tomatoes were delicious. I wish they would have used other lettuce other than just ice berg, but otherwise I can highly recommend it. 
Next up the pizzas: They were delicious. The Lasagna Pizza was unique and very tasty. I've never had ricotta on pizza and discovered a new topping I really enjoy. The pepperoni and mushroom had a generous amount of toppings. Both pies were baked perfectly. They both deserves a strong four out of five stars. 
The ambiance is a bit like a food court even though they serve beer and wine. Staff is exclusively 18 and under and friendly, but their inexperience shows.",4
261,"Was the second patient in the door. Still waited over a half an hour to be seen. Saw the nurse (not practitioner) for a total of 5 minutes and had a throat swab which took another half an hour. $1100. No thanks, I'll not be back.",1

263,"Went on a Tuesday around 11am. 

Saw the long line and thought briefly about finding another place, but decided to wait. We were SO glad we did. 

Line actually moved quickly. Coffee is great! I had the best banana bread pancakes and the cinnamon syrup is to die for. I also ordered a side of bacon, which was some of the best bacon I've ever had. My boyfriend had the classic buttermilk pancakes, which were just as good if that's more your style. 

Overall a wonderful experience. I'm drooling thinking about going back again.",5
264,The girl was unpleasant didn't take my order right and the driver was high or drunk. He asked me if he gave me the correct change. And the food was thrown together. I order here often and been a customer since I was a kid. I'm highly upset with this.,2
265,"Once inside, it was larger than I expected. There was a nice variety of dishes and the staff kept refilling popular items. I was a little disappointed in the General Tsao's Chicken, but on the whole everything was very tasty. Fell in love with the Honey Chicken, and I will definitely be making a return visit.",4
266,"I got the gyro ""platter"" for lunch, which was dry, uninspired, and nothing like a deconstructed gyro. Worst of all, it came with ""vegetables"" which looked more like poop. Tasted that way, too. There are better places in Fairmount for lunch, and they won't serve you poop, either.",1
267,"Scallion pancakes were quite good. Pork chop soup had great flavor and crunch. We also opted for one of the Indonesian curries, which had a nice mix of flavors. Courteous staff. When we asked for our leftovers to be packed to go, we didn't specify that the rice needed to be packed as well, and ended up with curry sans rice as leftovers. Worth trying once, not sure that this will go into my regular rotation.",3
268,"OK food... HORRIBLE customer service!
One weekend I ordered 4 extra large pizzas (totaling $65 WITH a coupon) and when we received our order it was completely wrong.  I called to report the issue and Adam (who claimed that he was a manager) said that he would ""take care"" of my order next time.  He also asked me to take pictures of my pizzas (which I did).  The following week I called Pizza Guys to place my order.  Prior to placing my order, I informed the girl of my arrangement with Adam.  She responded with ""Hmmm... hold on and let me figure that out"".  Adam came to the phone and when I reminded him of our arrangement, he took my order (which was the exact same order as the one they messed up on), he told me that the total was $88!  When I reminded him again of our agreement, he then stated that he can ""discount my order significantly"" bringing it down to $60.  I told him that I was not satisfied with that.  If I had them correct the order the first time, I would not have paid for their error then, so why should I pay for it this time?  Adam told me that was the best he can do... even as a manager!  I asked who his boss was and he stated that she was standing right next to him.  I asked to speak with her. He placed me on hold for about five minutes only to return and say that she sent him back to the phone and tell me that the best she can do was to bring the cost down to $55. Come to find out that this was the OWNER! She did not even have the decency nor respect to come to the phone and talk to me.  Instead of trying to correct their error, they acted as if I was just trying to get some free food! I have NEVER been so insulted nor experienced such poor customer service!  I will NEVER order from this location EVER again!  I even spoke with Director of Operations regarding the issue and although he apologized and asked for another chance, I told him that I would not feel comfortable nor would I put it past that staff to put something in my food!  In my opinion, customer service is just as important as the quality of food I am purchasing.  Again - I will NEVER order from this location again, and if you think that customer service is just as important as I do, then you won't order from them either!",1
269,very disappointed in the food...so let down i can't think of anything else to say,2
270,"Super disappointed to see that Grande Luxe Cafe has removed the short ribs pierogies and the bistro steak from their menu. Those two were my go to's! I will still go back for their lava cake but will continue to have a hard time understanding why these were removed for more ""greens"".",3

Boyfriend got the brisket enchiladas and he said that the charro beans tasted home-made and were his favorite part. We will definitely be returning.",5

Nastiest overpriced soggy fries and burger. So bad I fed the dumpster outside the restaurant. Ive seen food laying on the sidewalk more appetizing than what I got.
oh and don't think you are special. You don't walk out under $11 for anything and yes, everyone gets their drink in a styrofoam cup..

Pass.",1
276,"If you like eating pigs, you will like The Block.  They specialize in pork dishes.  However, I tried a beef brisket sandwich.  It was really, really good.  Smokey, tender, and juicy.  The burger that was also served at my table was significantly overcooked.  It was ordered medium and came out closer to well done.  We ate it anyway.  Everything was good.  The fried pork skin appetizer was a bit too salty.  

Overall, I was impressed, and will be back.  But if I'm spending $11 on a burger, I'm hoping it will be cooked closer to the correct temperature next time.",3
277,"This place did the trick for our trip.  First time to NOLA, and this hotel is right in the mix - French Quarter bordering the Business District and just a block off of Bourbon.  We'd kind of had enough of the tourist party trap after the first day or two and found ourselves wishing that we had stayed elsewhere in the city.  Fortunately, street noise was muffled and we slept well in their wee beds, and the rest of the city is but a quick escape in any direction.  You'll get gouged for parking here, but I think that's true of pretty much any hotel in the area.  At least you don't have to wait on valet, and the in-and-out is very quick.  You could actually easily do without a car if you're staying within the city limits, but work took us outside of NOLA's walls where no buses dare tread, so for us it was a necessary evil.  A bit outdated, but clean enough, quiet enough (with the exception of the screaming kid next door on our last night), free wifi (slow), free pool (small), and complementary toiletries for those who ask (I always ask).  Oh, I did think it unprofessional that our hotel didn't notify us of a water advisory that was issued by the Sewerage and Water Board on our second-to-last day in town.  We overheard a waiter at a restaurant saying that the tap water wasn't safe to drink.  So that would have been great to know!  Otherwise, our stay was fine.",3
278,"My husband's recently purchased truck began acting up, the cause couldn't be found. Someone where he worked recommended Sincere, so husband took truck there to have the problem diagnosed. They were quite busy, he had to leave the truck there overnite, no problems regarding vehicle break-ins or vandalism. When problem was diagnosed, the owner took his time to clearly explain the issues, & recommended that out of the possibilities, 1 or 2 sensors were usually responsible for the problem & to try replacing them 1st before he went deeper. Husband purchased both sensors elsewhere, did the repairs himself, & thanks to Sincere's diagnostics, truck is now running like a well oiled piece of machinery. We appreciate the extra time the owner gave us. We'd go back. Please note that we did not have them do any actual repairs so I can't attest to the quality of repair work, but I HAVE noticed they do quite a lot of business, so that speaks volumes too.  Might I also mention that the waiting room is very clean, has some beautiful plants, & a reasonably priced candy machine! Thank you, Sincere!",5
279,The theme of the resturant is a lot of fun with all of the prohibition photographs and other fun decor. The food and drinks were all pretty good but the one thing that would make me not come back to this restaurant are the overly high chairs and tables. My entire party had to literally climb up into the chairs and then you feel like you are jumping down when you had to get out of the chair. At one point one person in our party went to the restroom and came back and stood the rest of the time because they said it was too hard to get back into the high chair. These were handmade and the person who made them neglected to use proper height measurements for high top tables and chairs. They are a safety hazzard.,3
280,Liked Blue Bell Pizza the first time. Went there tonight because I read the wings were good and that's what we wanted. My husband had to wait 30 minutes longer than quoted. He got home and they forgot part of our order. I called and the girl was helpful and nice and said they would deliver it right away. 45 minutes-nothing. I called back and there was confusion but they tried to deliver to another house. No call. Nothing. The girl offered a credit. We aren't going back so it doesn't matter. In a town with a bunch of decent places-it's just not worth it.,1
281,Unfortunately my dog passed away due to another (completely different company) facilities negligent behavior. But this place was very amazing with trying to help save her and how they treated us after the very hard emotional experience we went through. Thank you for the amazing staff and service. It made this heartbreakingly horrible experience a bit easier,5
282,"I went to Thai taste for lunch the other day, and ordered the eggplant dish with tofu, which included jasmine rice, a spring roll, and a salad, all for about $6.  I appreciate all the choices Thai Taste gives its customers: mild, medium, or hot spiciness,  rice or noodles, tofu or meat.  The smiling server brought the salad quickly, and it was just a small bowl of iceberg lettuce with some shredded carrot, but the dressing they used was very tasty.  The main course wasn't long coming.  The tofu was well-done, but the eggplant wasn't cooked enough for my liking.  I ordered medium spicy, which was intense without being overwhelming.  I would definitely give Thai Taste another try - my friends' meals both looked great, the service was quick, the place is clean and quiet, and the prices are very reasonable.",4
283,"There are bars you can still smoke in?! Yuck. Sorry smokers (I used to be one so I get it) but yuck. The stink of smoke in my hair woke me up in the middle of the night after stopping in here and was so bad I had to get up to wash it before I could get back to sleep. That's not good.

Definitely a dive, this bar is very dim and smokey. The bartender was friendly and came to take my order as soon as I walked up to the bar. The bloody mary I ordered wasn't that great or strong, though.  That's not good either.",2
284,"I hadn't been back to Gulifity's in years. Growing up in the area, it was always a compromise destination one of the few places that was more than eating in a bar, but less than a fancy night out. I remember an unfocused menu and a dining room awkwardly subdivided. Since then, they've renovated and overhauled their menu. The dining room is now wide open, with a row of banquettes separating it from the bar area. It retains the smaller seating area by the entrance, and has added a large outdoor bar. 

I ended up there twice in recent months. The first I met up with people for happy hour. We started outside, gathered around a long hightop table. There was a good selection of beers out there, though different from inside. There was adequate shade for the late afternoon sun, but the humidity got to be a bit much, as with any outdoor bar. Once everyone showed up, we decided to move inside.

The bar is downstairs from the main entrance, and our large group colonised the large high-top in the middle of the bar area. It had some of those self-service taps you sometimes see at large sportsbars, but we didn't try them out. The beer list inside was much more expansive, with plenty of choices for all tastes. There's also a large variety of appetizers. I had the buffalo chicken dip, with pita wedges, and also tried some buffalo popcorn chicken and  alligator tacos, and everything was pretty good.

I went back a few weeks later for dinner. We sat in the dining area, in a slightly uncomfortable highbacked booth. We started with the calimari, which were lightly breaded and crispy, but may have too many mini-squid and too few rings for some tastes. I had an apple burger, which was a nice twist on the usual bacon bleu burger. I also tried some of the buffalo fajita, which was pretty spicy.",3
285,"Terrible terrible terrible. Out of 6 meals we ordered to go, 5 had to be thrown away. We were missing half the components that were supposed to be part of the meal (no buns for our burgers, no fries that were supposed to come with it) items which were described as vegetarian came with bacon, it was just a major fail all the way around. The few components that we did try were completely flavorless. We will never go back or order from here again. Waste of time and money as I then had to go home make make dinner.",1
286,So I had a overall good meal but service was not very good and I ordered a New York strip with no mushrooms cause I'm allergic to mushrooms but they gave me them anyway I got mashed potatoes with gravy on the side but it came on top last but not least I ordered green beans and got broccoli but overall besides that it was a pretty good meal,2
287,"Nice cheap motel across the street from the beach. Nothing fancy or special but serves its purpose nonetheless. One problem with this motel was the employees. At night, they got a little noisy and we had to tell the female employee to keep it down while she was on her cell phone talking loudly right outside our room. Other than that, great location and great for the money's worth.",3
288,"Just had lunch there, ordered the red bean and rice meat lovers classic. It was had good flavor. The portions are huge for lunch and the prices are great. Just wished they had more dinner items on the lunch menu, was craving pasta - none available on the lunch menu.",3
289,"The Red Piano is a cool hang out spot if you want to just hang out and have a couple of drinks. My colleagues and I decided to try this out since it seemed like a cool place. Being told there was a dress code from the hostess the security said it would be okay for us to come in since we did not know.

In the middle of the restaurant was a red piano where they play the songs the customer requests, which is pretty cool because they add their own little style to each song. 

Down to the food, I ordered the crab mac n cheese which made me feel sick right after. The taste was not there, it was too salty and something about it did not taste right. However, for starters we ordered the meatballs, which okay nothing that would make me want more. The service was okay, our waitress was slow and it took a while for us to get our drinks as well as appetizers.",3
290,"I really like this place a lot. We originally came here to check out the brunch menu but we arrived too early and only the breakfast menu was available. We got the sausage biscuit which was alright... I don't think it was anything special or worth the price tag. We were so disappointed with our limited options that we decided to come back to dinner the same night. We got the stuffed oysters, pâté, burger and fried oyster salad. The stuffed oysters have definitely been the best oysters I've had in NOLA thus far... Or ever. He pâté was also delicious and one of the best I've ever had. I didn't try the burger but it looked perfectly cooked. The fried oyster salad was such a let down. The fried oysters were not good. It was more batter than oyster... And overly seasoned in my opinion. The best thing about the salad was the avocado...
The service was great and food came out speedy. I would highly recommend coming here for the oysters and pâté alone!!",4
291,"I've been to Village Whiskey twice; once in 2012 and I just returned in November 2015. After my first experience I ranked the burger pretty high. A lot has changed since then. Shake Shack came to town (literally right across the street) and I've eaten numerous delicious burgers. Returning around 5:45 on a Friday we were lucky to score seats at the end of the skinny counter in the back of the restaurant. It is very tight quarters and there are no hooks for purses or coats. We started with the fried shrimp as an appetizer. The portion size allowed an easy split between two people. They were small shrimp served with a dipping sauce with a bit of a spicy kick. I had the village burger and added cheese for an extra $2.50 accompanied by duck fat fries.  The burger was decent, but I would not longer suggest it is worth the wait or the cramped quarters if you don't have a table. The service was shotty, as we had to constantly ask for refills on our water and diet cokes. We didn't even have drinks when our entrees arrived. They don't take reservations so it's really luck of the draw coming here.",3
292,"In a nutshell: If you want a burger, salad, or Kale/Quinoa bowl that's served using real ingredients that aren't artificial or overly-processed, I found the place for you.

I ordered the Cousin Oliver Turkey Burger the first time (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, & pickles) and the Adopted Luke Turkey Burger the second time (Caramelized onions, Swiss cheese, Mushrooms, & BBQ Sauce). Both burgers were great although it definitely was not dripping with oil. You can order both varieties in Beef, Veggie, & Chicken burger forms too.

For me (and the intended audience of this place), that's probably a good thing. Admittedly, I also didn't order a Beef Burger which might have been more typical to a burger you'd expect at a pub or something but then again, that's not really the mission of b.good anyway.

My mom ordered the Southwestern Chicken salad which she also liked. It's nothing abnormally special over a typical salad you'd expect but there's nothing wrong about it for sure.

A big thing about this place is definitely the drinks. For starters, all of their sodas & drinks are homemade, using no artificial ingredients or HFCS. Also, a ton of people were walking out with green/vegetable smoothies. I never tried one yet but a lot of people seems to like it.

The big hurdle that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars is the price. Sure, you don't have to tip and yes, they do a good job with the food. But considering you'll be walking out paying at least $10 for a burger, drink, and fries... I don't know how I feel about that. The price of a combo is awfully similar to buying everything al-carte. I feel like they could get away with making the prices of a combo cheaper so people have more incentive to buy more.

But if you're in the market for 'junk' food, served in a 'not-junk' food kind of way, I think you're in for a treat with b.good.",4
293,"Fun place in downtown st Pete. Drinks are fantastic. I always go with an old fashioned and it was very well made. My date had a whiskey sour which they made with actual egg white. A nice and pleasant change. The drink was very tasty. Great spot to go for a date, but it is rather cramped inside at times. I went on a Friday around 9 and it was packed, which is to be expected. Even with the business, it wasn't a terrible wait to get a drink",4

297,"312 is consistently the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever experienced. 

I want to give this place 5 stars for the 3 times I've been here when the food was excellent and the service was on point; however, for the 4 times I've been here when it was terrible, I simply cannot...

The first two deep dish pizzas I ordered here were perfect... The right amount of cheese, meat, and messy-ness. The encounters thereafter just weren't the same. 

For our (fiancé and I) next visit, we ordered wings, a basket of fries, and a sandwich. Well, the wings came out raw, we received a sandwich that tasted like they bought it from a gas station, soaked it in water and put it in the microwave. Half the fries were undercooked while the other half were fine. We spoke to the manager, who apologized and gave us a free pizza coupon. Good show of customer service there. 

Well, that free pizza was divine. Another shocking turn in the tale of 312. 

Recently, we came in later on a Saturday (1030PM) with five people. We take a seat and 20 minutes go by without anyone coming by...we leave. 

We STILL have faith in this place...

And here are we tonight. We come back and the pizza is 5 seconds from being completely burnt. 

PLEASE 312, I want to love you but you are making it really effing hard......",2
298,"I have been to numerous different nail salons and spas in Tucson to get a pedicure, and this place takes the cake and others were major flops! For starters, this location offers personal boxes for a one time fee of $5 with your own nail tools, which really makes me feel more sanitary. In addition, the chemical smells of most nail salons is pretty much non-existent here, which really appeals to me. Their location is very spacey and welcoming and on top of that everything is very clean and well kept. Great place to come to really relax and get your nails done. For $25 you can get a great pedicure, and for $30 you can get their additional callous treatment, and while it's gross to see what can come off your feet, it leaves them feeling like a babies butt. Compare them, I dare ya! ; ) Worth the extra $5 for me! And something that a lot of nail salons struggle to fix for me is ingrown toe nails. Not that any of you needed to know that about me, but it's a big deal to me to have found a place that can not only fix them, but do a spectacular job that will last until my next monthly pedicure!  If you haven't found a good place to get your nails done in Tucson, definitively give this place a try!",4
299,"Whirled Peace was perfect for this abnormally warm January Saturday!

I helped myself to samples of a few flavors. How great is it that they put out the small sample cups so you can do that?

Their tart plain and chocolate are solid. I am not a huge fan of the delche de leche or the egg nog. Maybe a little too artificial. 

But red velvet...wow!

I can't kvell over this flavor enough. Its been done to death in cupcakes and donuts but I had not seen it as a yogurt/ice cream flavor. It worked. So well. The machine called it low fat but I'm skeptical because it tasted way too good to be lowfat. 

One little note: the containers say all the store's products are compostable. So why is there no compost receptacle in the store? Compostable spoons and cups do nothing good for the environment in a landfill.",4

301,"This was my second visit here.  My first visit went off without a hitch, not so much this time.  I drove down from Brooklyn to meet up with a girlfriend there.  We arrived around 5:15 pm and were told that they only do tastings from Noon-5 pm.  We were told that we could buy full glasses if we wanted too and that there would be live music shortly and pizza. The lady went on further to explain that it gets really busy and they do not have the staff or time to dedicate to a full tasting after 5 pm.  We told them that we didn't need the full breakdown and we know exactly what we wanted and they still said no.  Now the interesting thing is that a couple pulled up right before us and they were walking in while we were parking and we see that they are standing next to us doing a tasting.  So now I'm pissed because they clearly walked in and got a tasting but we are being told something different.  Fast forward, we got two glasses and took a seat.  We were there until about 6 pm and wouldn't you know it they were still doing tastings with other couples that were there as well as the couple that walked in before us.  I bought two bottles of the white Merlot just because I had been raving about it to a friend  and wanted them to taste it.  However I won't be going out of my way to return here again, customer service plays a huge role in where I spend my money at and they failed me here.  I realize they have a policy and but when you are blatantly ditching your policy for another couple but not for us I know it's bs.  In their defense I did not tell them that I came all the way down from Brooklyn, however I didn't feel the need to when I saw they were serving that other couple because they clearly had their minds made up.  Oh and from the time we walked in only 2 or 3 more people came in so it wasn't busy and there were about 5 people behind the counter and another handful of people coming in and out of the kitchen.  

I gave it 2 stars for the taste of the white Merlot only.  We also had the spumante secco (?) and I've had better tasting sparkling wine for a liquor store for half the price.  My girlfriend wanted to taste the spumante rose but they didn't have any more of it. 
This is worth a visit if you are going to pass it but other than that go to New Hope for the vineyards over there! Cheers!",2

After I got my food I walked out the door and I check my order,  I order 6 large fries and somethings else but 1 large fries is missing so have have to go back to the store and this rude lady which the one give me the order. Same way she throw that fries in front of me. With the customer came back with the order is missing she didn't even apologize just throw the order to me and walked away.

With kids!! The waitress is being so lovely about it, very apologetic etc, brought us a free appetizer, but still. About 6 weeks ago we had the same experience here, long waits for food, mixed up orders, apologetic wait staff. What on earth is going on with management?

I found the glasses on The Eye Bar website but wanted to confirm that they had the glasses in stock so I called.  Stacey said she did not have the glasses at this location but she would call around to see if any of their sales reps had them in stock in their other locations.   I got a call back about a week later and they found the glasses.  I ordered the glasses online right away and received them today, it was perfect, complete with the limited edition case.

Either we caught the place on an off-night or the management has really taken a poor turn.  At the ordering area, the food obviously did not look fresh; it appeared to have been sitting there for many hours unrefrigerated before our arrival.  I hesitated but ordered a veggie pizza for myself and he ordered a hawaiian pizza.  It took nearly 20 minutes for our food to arrive, even though there were very few people in the restaurant.  When our food was finally ""ready"" it was cold and soggy (even though the pizza had ostensibly been warmed up).  It was the worst pizza I have ever had from anywhere in town.  Total disappointment.  I won't be returning.  Go to Frog next door instead.",1

314,"I usually try hard to not judge a place first by reading people's reviews but instead my own experience at the place. However, today, I would have to agree with the rest of the members who rated this place 2 stars.

Let me first state that this review of 2 stars is based on personal incident.
-----------
My husband and I arrived when there was two other tables occupied and sat down with our menus.

Another couple came in after and was waited on no longer than 5 mins. I looked at the young girl who was the only one out there and kind of let her know that we were ready to order.

At this point, I was already thinking: ""Wow, she didn't bother coming to us to even ask if we needed water or anything, yet she walks over to the other table who came in after us and offered drinks?!? ummm""

She came over after she was done w/ taking that table's orders and bringing out their drinks to them.

We told her our orders and things went smoothly during the process. 

After we were done eating, it was time to pay. I walked to the counter to let her know I was ready, and also showed her my groupon. She told me that the bill came out to be $3.16. I promptly and politely handed her a $5 bill and waited for her to give change back.

She stared at the $5 and RUDELY (and I mean, with attitude and a scoff) said: ""What, you don't have 16 cents?""

I was a little taken aback by her scoff and said: ""I do have it, hold on a sec!"" and pulled out 16 cents and laid it out on the counter.

She then takes all the change, scoots it towards herself on the counter, picks up her cell phone and starts texting on it while completely writing me off/ ignoring me. The whole next 30 sec, I was shocked at her rudeness as she knew I was standing there, waiting for change of $2 back.

Now, I always tip people, and I was def. planning on tipping this girl even for  poor service, but what REALLY killed me was that she EXPECTED a tip from me. The fact that she also didn't even bother asking me if I wanted change back really got under my skin. She literally just took the money out of my reach and left me hanging and started to play on the cellphone like: ""You aren't going to be stingy enough to ask me for $2 change now are you?""

I obviously figured out her conniving plan and basically decided it wasn't worth my time to deal with her bullsh*t and walked out. She may have thought she ""won"" her $2 tip, but I was actually going to tip her more than $2. I guess being a bitch waitress sure can bite you in the back! 

--------------------FOOD RATING---------------------------
Food was decent, and was well worth the Groupon purchased, for $10+ $3.16 = $13.16 we were able to get egg rolls for appetizers, a large bowl of Pho, a bowl of cold vermicelli noodles and meat with a mango drink. 

If it wasn't for the service, I would have given this place a 3 star, but because of the waitress and her attitude and just plain RUDENESS, I can only give it a 2 star, and I will DEFINITELY NOT be coming back to this place again.",2
315,"The smoothies are ok, every time I get one they have some chunks of frozen fruit in it...which is annoying. It's just an ok place, nothing fantastic.",3
316,"Went within the first week, totally anticipate 3 stars to go up and not down, but frankly they are not there yet.

Definite mis-steps in service, culminating in sitting at the table for 15 minutes with no menu and no water (even though three lovely people asked our water preference, it was tap every time) 

When we did get the menu, we found out we were to order 4 courses, with 6 choices between each. We all shared so I had a good chance to taste a lot of things, heres the rundown

foie gras soup- good flavor overall but random bites of spices were way too overpowering

sweetbreads- one of my favorite bites of the night, cooked perfectly

some weird caesar thing- please take it off the menu

eggplant terrine- I enjoyed this more than others at the table

Black cod- not my favorite from the fish course, I thought my fish was overcooked and rather bland

Clams and orrechiette- best fish course in my opinion, get this!
(i also liked the ravioli w'anchovie fish course)

Lamb Belly- which is not lamb belly at all, but lamb breast, was a good dish was the sesame granola not only killed it for me, but killed my teeth as well

Squab- unbelievably cooked, tough protein to cook and they did it with skill, best meat course dish of the night

meatloaf-very very ehhhh

i loved my dessert!! I finally got one right with the desert course, the apple mille fuille with caramel sorbet was awesome, best dessert on the table even with the iron chef winning panna cotta

like I said, this place will get better but it is not there yet, in my humble opinion",3
317,"Thank you yelp! We came in on for Sunday brunch and requested something we've seen on YELP! They were more than happy to replicate the dish. We also ordered raw oysters and crab benedict.

319,"I am an ex-server for olive garden. It is one of my favorite restaurants and I drove over half an hour to eat there with two of my friends on Thursday may 31st. Our servers were Tracey and mikayla, whose was training, and I was extremely disappointed in the service that we recieved.
I'd like to highlight first the some service that met the outstanding expectations that I know olive garden expects.
When we arrived we were seated right away and our server in training introduced herself fairly quickly. We were given adequate time to look at the menu and make our selections. Our first round of salad and bread sticks, along with our appetizer very quickly. After this though the whole atmosphere and attitude seemed to change.
Our tray of breadsticks and salad stood empty for almost 20 minutes after that initial  round. One of the reasons I love olive garden is because of the refills on salad, soup, and breadsticks. While we waited on someone to recognize that we needed refills, a tray of dirty dishes sat out in the dining room for approximately 30 minutes across from our table. Our main courses came out before our second round of salad and breadsticks and when I recieved my entree the sauce in the ravioli de portabellas that I had ordered congealed and the entree was cold. I flagged down a server as no one had asked us how are meal was. Although my meal was replaced with no question, it came out after both of my friends were finished eating and had recieved to-go boxes, so I was eating my meal alone. After we were all done eating, everything was boxed up, and dishes were cleared we then waited over another 15 minutes for my dessert to-go and our check. Finally when we did receive our check it was the wrong one. Thankfully I was planning on paying with a credit card so I didn't just leave money on the table and walk out. 
Again I am very disappointed in the service I recieved tonight. The problem with our service is that there was no direction from the server that was training the new employee. Tracey seemed to be more worried about a large party that was sitting behind us but made a point to mention in passing that mikayla better do good tonight because she was making her money. Now I understand the basis behind why trainees give their tips to their trainer, as I went through the training myself, but tracy was not guiding her, checking on the table or shadowing her anyway. I feel like mikayla was sent out to the wolves with no food.",1
320,"The best everything! Purchased the German chocolate cake, fresh pasta, Alfredo sauce, and shrimp. Wish the store the wasn't so crowded but it's that good you tolerate the closeness of your fellow shoppers.",5
321,"OMG the Buffalo tails must be made with Crack! !! I can't stop eating them!

Seriously,  with the light flour dusting these are perfect. Got with mild - super tasty and a side of hot for those more adventurous in our group. 50 tails for our family of 3 lasts about 3 days!",5
322,"Went here for dinner. I got the Rock Point Grouper and partner got the Begger's Salmon. The salmon was pretty creative (the wrapping for the salmon was in the shape of an onion and the entire thing was edible; it was a nice mix of crunchy and meaty, but the salmon was dry). For the grouper, it tasted very done up in that there was tons of sauce and spices that ultimately overpowered the food; in its description it seems tasty. 

Don't get the mashed potatoes. It looked like it was squeezed out of a tube and it doesn't taste creamy, just heavy. 

Overall, for a seafood dinner, I've had better. Reading the other reviews, though, I'd want to go for brunch.",2
323,"The pizza turned out good.  Better than I expected.  The service was okay.  The Thai chili chicken wings were pretty good.  It was nice and neat inside.  

I'll go back, next time I'm in the mood for pizza.",4
324,"According to management, the fire marshal will not allow you to park your stroller by your table (despite having ample room to get through).  They could see we had a sleeping child in the stroller, but made no effort to come up with any sort of accommodation.  There were many tables at the front of the restaurant where we could have kept the stroller right next to us.  We asked if we could sit there instead.  They hemmed and hawed and finally said ok, but by that time, we were fed up and left.",1
325,This place has terrible customer service. I pulled up to the rails and 1 of the employees walked out and acted like I didn't stop. He started shaking his head and acting like I was an idiot. Hey. Your the idiot who waves people up to you and don't move out of the way. I'll never be back. Watch out. They are looking to sue somebody for their stupidity.,1
326,"Ok, I've let over a month go by so I could write this free of emotion. I did my wedding block at hotel MONACO. The hotel itself is beautiful, which is why I didn't give it 1 star. Customer service was god awful. Between the many rooms booked, drinks and food purchased, my friends, family and I collectively spent 30k $ at this hotel, which for Philly is as expensive as it gets. When you spend this much, I expect to have nothing but the best customer service. Sadly I received the opposite. My correspondent at the hotel gave us a tour and said we were free to use the stratus as our after party location. However; when my guests arrived they were told they needed to pay 20$ cover each to get in. So I guess the 30k wasn't enough. When my husband and I went in (we booked the suite for 600$ a night) the bouncer started screaming at us for ""trying to sneak in,"" pointing his finger about an inch from my eye ball. I told him who my correspondent was for the block and he said the stratus had nothing to do with my block, despite me being told the exact opposite. I went down to complain and the manager apologized. However at this point half my guests left because they were afraid of said bouncer. I was informed that he was fired as a result but doesn't change that the after party was ruined. I asked for some fort of comp/refund and all they could do was refund me 75$. Really, that's worse than nothing given what we spent on the block. The second issue was that all my guests missed my shuttle to our venue because driver was instructed to go to another street by hotel but hotel failed to inform any of my guests who were all waiting where we were told by the hotel to have them wait. When I called the hotel later to complain about this a manager named Christie said ""let me stop you right there, we have nothing to do with hotel blocks. That's like expecting an ER surgeon to know how an emergency department works."" Oh man was that the wrong analogy, as I'm an emergency medicine physician. I informed her that a TRAUMA surgeon certainly knows how an ED is run, that we operate in teams. Emergency physicians actually work integrally with trauma. Clearly the concept of working as a team with the various departments in a foreign concept to this hotel. I took insult to this comparison as she clearly was using this completely incorrect analogy complemented with major attitude as a tool to make her dissatisfied customer feel stupid. Too bad I'm a doctor and she's not. (As a side note, I normally never tell people I'm a doc or ask to be called Doctor as I find it to be pretentious.) I called management to complain but they told me there was nothing they could do as they already gave me the very generous 75$ discount already. Very disappointed. I've stayed in hotels all over the world and have never received such poor customer service in my life. They were acting like they were doing me a favor by letting me have my block there and give them 30k$. I've been treated better at hostels in developing countries. Seriously they don't deserve to have 5 stars despite the beautiful finishings and great location. Pretty sure 5 stars is supposed to imply nothing but the best customer service.",2
327,"Great store if you like 50's-Midcentury modern! The prices are a little high compared to my favorite stores in STL, but this store is one of a kind thats for sure!",4
328,My friend and I came in quick to do our nails. We are visiting family from New York and New Jersey where it can be pretty pricey with no pay off. The ladies here did a great job and were very sweet to us. I LOVE how my nails turned out. Can't stop looking at them. We will definitely come again whenever we are back in the area!,5
329,"We came in last Saturday for dinner. The food was delicious, The owner was very  gracious, and our server Ed, was the best waiter we've ever had at any restaurant over the past 25 years.  Anyone who likes great BYOB Italian food, should definitely try Fellini Cafe in Newtown Square!",5
330,Either they have the smoothest vodka I've ever tasted or the bartender forgot to add any to our drinks. Pretty sure it was the latter. With so many great bars on Mass Ave we won't be back here anytime soon.,2
331,"I came into the minute clinic with my 2 and 4 year old boys. We got in line at the kiosk in hopes of being seen.

While the kiosk seems convenient at first, the elderly man in line ahead of us took over thirty minutes to sign in. Multiple times I had to assist him, because there was nobody around to notice or offer any help. The system required him to enter an email address, and he didn't have one.

When it was finally our turn to sign in, we found that there was only one appointment left, and we needed three. The next appointment was for an hour and a half later. 

By this point, my boys were quite unhappy and loud. We decided to leave and find somewhere else .",2
332,"Recently rented a one-way car from National which we dropped off at the PHL location.  It was a great ride to have over the holidays as we visited family in varying parts of the northeast.  However, we misread our original contract and ended up getting charged for something that totally caught us off-guard.  It honestly would have been a major blow to our holiday joy had it not been for the manager & customer service rep on location in PHL on duty on 12/30/2012.  They could see that we were desparate and genuinely unaware of the charges and they helped us to pay what we thought we had originally agreed to.  It reinstated my faith in humanity.  But then as we walked out the shuttle bus to the airport had just pulled away... we thought we'd be stuck waiting for another 20 minutes and every minute counts at the airport.  But sure enough, the kind-hearted driver saw us in the rear-view and backed up the bus.  What a nice guy.  

Bottom Line: amazing customer service, great product and reasonable prices.  Can't ask for much more.",5
333,"Ordered from them via POSTMATES. My coworker pretty much finished his sweet and sour dish when discovered a dead bug that been cooked in his entree. When I called to report issue, a new gentleman said he would call his manager. He called me right back and said that manger said ""If you want a refund call POSTMATES"". I understand we ordered through a third party delivery service, however POSTMATES didn't make the food. Very disappointed and grossed out. Will not be returning due to poor customer service.",1
334,"I'm a sucker for some good plain chocolate ice cream, but I had to get the Triple Threat on my first time here - chocolate ice cream, chocolate brownie chunks, and chocolate chips. Sooooooo good. It's a little expensive, but I think all good ice cream places are. My boyfriend got the mint chocolate chop ice cream, which is infused with mint oil or something like that. He loved it. The girl there took the time to explain to us that they're the only place in Arizona that has a license to pasteurized their own ice cream, giving it a fresh, distinct taste.",5
335,"Great sandwiches! They run about $5-$7 each and no they don't come with French fries but if you compare that to the average sandwich at a certain sandwich chain that claims to have 12-inch sandwiches, Javan's sandwiches at only 9 inches for the large size blow commercial chain sandwiches to smithereens. Super packed with meat, cheeses, vegetables, and whatever else you want, I've gotten the Chicken Club and the Philly Cheesesteak and both are to die for. French-fries here are great too. 

Really great for groups of college kids, there's a lot of space indoors and outdoors, a large TV and old school arcade games. Definitely bring cash though, like most places in IV there is a 50 cent charge on Credit/Debit cards.",5
336,"OMG...from the (real) garlic  knots the the freshest salad & homemade dressing to the chilled chianti & my chicken pavano (and my friends chicken spinach fuit), EVERYTHING was phenomenal!!

337,"I wish I could give them more than 5 stars. Banko overhead doors was recommended to me by a neighbor who was a residential construction foreman, now retired. My experience was similar to William H. My spring broke and I was stuck in the garage. Banko sent someone immediately and the technician explained what had happened, fixed the door and cleaned everything up before he left. I would absolutely recommend this company to anyone who wants excellent service at a reasonable price.",5
338,"If i could give this place a negative 5 stars I would in a heart beat. I showed up and not only waited quite awhile for one drink (which is a small square bar) but the waitress who I assume is pregnant, was extremely short and rude but appeared to be overly nice and friendly to the ""regulars."" I, a female, was waiting for my girlfriend to show up. The bartender saw my GF (not knowing she was with me) walking outside to enter and gave a dirty look. And then continued to whisper to a co-worker pointing over at her and laughing. It was extremely inappropriate and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you are a homophobic hater like they are. And of course, if waiting a long time for another drink is ok with you. Was very disappointed and hurt my heart to see such hatred homophobic people who aren't afraid to laugh at someone who is ""obviously"" gay walk into their bar.",1
339,"Great little spot with fresh ice cream, pizzas, sandwiches, and beer! The ice cream was amazing and incredibly fresh. Locally owned so nice to support the community. Right off the Pinellas Trail with a nice sized patio so this it's really convenient lunch stop on a long ride.",5
340,"my girlfriend and i came in for a quick breakfast, and we ordered the prosciutto baguette, along with the egg in a basket and an order of zeppoli. 

overall, everything was really great! the baguette was nicely crisped and the filling was flavorful. the egg in a basket had a perfectly soft-boiled egg inside and was cheesy and delicious. the zeppoli were super awesome, crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside. i would sleep in a bed of those zeppoli if i could. 

on the way out i purchased a lemon bar and i'm eating it as i speak this review. i was going to do 4.5 stars but the lemon bar definitely raised it up. highly recommend. 

my only complaint was that our food wasn't as hot as it could be, but i'm going to chalk that up to the owner being the only person working at the time in the morning -- she's a lovely person, very friendly, and she had her hands full, so no worries!",5
341,"Excellence in the 10 prepared dishes on vegetarian lunch buffet.  The many dishes included a nice selection and blends of greens, corn, carrots, potato, cabbage, eggplant, lentils, green beans and rice.  I especially liked the eggplant, the spicy lentils and the spicy potato with peppers. Not too spicy, just enough to satisfy my capsicum craving. Over rice or wrapped in authentic enjera, it makes a most satisfying mid-day repast.   Kale and spinach rounded out a filling healthful meal.  Iced tea capped off a perfect experience.  I do need a nap now.",5
342,"Customer service is terrible, I don't think they clean the theaters in-between viewings and the lines are always outrageously long for tickets and snacks because they are understaffed. The main attraction is the upgrade they did to the seats in each theater. The seats alone aren't worth it. There are other theaters in the area that are much better.",2
343,"AWFUL!  Rents increase 10% per year (national average is 3%).  If you call with a concern or let them know about any type of issue, they log it in and I swear they use it against you when it's time to renew your lease and penalize you.  It  actually says when you renew how many times you have called in the course of the year.  If they can't fix a clogged sink, then why should you get charged more the following year???  The staff is extremely rude and confrontational (naturally sweet as can be when you are signing up).  The supposed business center which is for your use has 2 computers and 1 is never working.  They are abrupt and ignorant to deal with.  The maintenance and security are a joke.  The walls are thin and you  hear your neighbors at all hours of the day or night stomping up and down the stairs or just walking in their apartment (it reverberates like they are stomping their feet).  

They claim they will pick up your packages but if you are not there within 2 days to pick it up, they get snippy. (How are you able to pick it up when you actually work 9-5???)  Their office hours are 9-5:30 so it's virtually impossible to get there when they are open.  Not everyone sticks around for the weekend to fit their schedule.  They could easily adjust their schedules to coordinate with tenants but that would be too tenant friendly.

If you place a service call, you're lucky if they show up within the week .. .let alone with a day or two.  The person in charge lets her voice mail fill to capacity so she doesn't have to bother getting additional calls.  

They suck!",1
344,"Definitely my last resort when it comes to movie theaters in the area.  They're always the most expensive around and it's not even like you're getting something special (i.e. lounge chairs) with the extra cost.  The bathrooms are always really messy and most times there is some kind of disturbance during the movie.  The one good thing is they almost always have a time that you can make, which is why it's always my last resort.  There's also a T.G.I. Friday next door if you want to do dinner and a movie.  Check other theaters before this one!",2
345,"I enjoyed my dinner at Southgate, but definitely felt like they skimped on the Korean flavor. Tried the KFC wings (both flavors), they had a delicious crunch but definitely not spicy. Same with the spicy fries. You can see they dusted it with something but the taste does not translate. The dolsot bibimbap was ok. Nothing particularly great to justify the $17 price tag. Service from the kitchen was very slow, long wait after our wings. The waiter and bartender were both great. And we enjoyed our cocktails, which were well crafted and delicious.",3
346,"I'm trying to think of something I don't like about this place.... I'll work on that while I write this review. The Block is styled as a neighborhood restaurant/butcher shop. Granted, it's a pretty nice neighborhood. But The Block is always welcoming, never stuffy. As far as the butcher shop - they do have a nice, but not huge butcher case. Most of their butcher skills are shown off in the menu, where they do delicious things to mostly very local meats. Lots of pork - smoked, pulled, grilled, made into jam (yes, bacon jam). Beef is offered as a burger and a butcher's cut of the day. Chicken is a lovely roasted breast. But these folks know what they're doing with veggies, too. The flash-fried brussel sprouts will bring tears to your eyes. Their seasonal salads show off produce like gem-colored beets and tender asparagus.
And their bartenders know what they're doing - from the fancy-schmancy cocktails to the craft beers and a nice wine list. They are skilled and knowledgable. I love this place.",4
347,"This is good southern barbecue meets fast food. Excellent pulled pork / beef / turkey barbecue, on a typical fast food bun. By default it comes with mayonaise, cole slaw, and pickles on the burger (so be sure to ask for those to be omitted if you don't like them).

I had the pulled pork. It was juicy and tasty. The beef was good, but a bit dry. Service was quite fast, and there is a drive through.

Note: No seating available at this location, so this is To-Go only.

They have very minimal choice of sides (slaw, baked beans, or potato chips). Not particularly healthy. But still quite tasty.",4
348,"big store, lots of stuff, a little disheveled ( im not sure if thats a word, but it fits). They did have a lot of stuff on clearance so there are probably deals to be had.",2
349,"I wish I could give less than one star. Purchased two paintings on Liveauctioneers.com from them. They arrived today with one in pieces, splinters everywhere, and rusty nails jutting out. Both are dry rotted and appear to have been stored improperly. Only by sheer luck did I not cut myself. I contacted them and unethically they tried to blame it on the shipper, however the shipper did not cause dry rot. I spoke with the shipper who told me the bottom snapped off while still in the gallery but they sent it anyway. Obviously their intent was to take my money and deliver a broken, damaged product. Thank goodness the shipper took pictures while still at Material Culture. 
I was told someone would get back to me today, but as expected no one called.",1

Their food is alright, but the food at Caffe Milano is better.  This restaurant is ok, but if you want good Italian food in this neighborhood, I recommend checking out Caffe Milano.  The quality is better there, and it isn't that much more expensive.",3
352,"Last time we were here the service was great, so on a rainy Thursday we thought P. F. Changs would be a treat. We sat for ten minutes without acknowledgement and were finally greeted by the frantic manager. He brought us waters and promised a server would be over immediately. Another five minutes passed before our overbearing server arrived. She only had two tables. She tried to offer us more time to look over the menu, which we had practically memorized by then. We put in our dinner orders right away. When she gave us our dishes a few minutes later, she disappeared. We were finished our meals and sitting for 8-10 minutes when she reappeared. By that time, she asked about dessert and tried to go get us a menu but again, we knew we couldn't let her out of our sight without losing her forever. When we placed our orders, we agreed to each other to ask for the check when she dropped the desserts. Of course, she had a runner come to our two top with our desserts. One and a half hours for a dinner/dessert for two (no drinks) in a quiet restaurant is absurd. The food was fine, but not worth the frustration and invisible customer status.",2
353,"The food tastes great but portions are small. First, we ordered fried calamari, which is always a shareable appetizer. It was s portion meant for one person. For my main coarse I ordered Surf & Turf. ( $38.00 ) I asked the waiter if the amount of filet mignon medallions would be sufficient...He said "" yes, it's s big portion"".  I received two small medallions, each being bite size. The lobster was also small but I expected that. When I brought my dissatisfaction to the waiters attention , he agreed that there should have been more and apologized. That was it ! Nothing was done to rectify the extremely small portion. Thankfully, I was able to fill up on the steak fries. For the price I paid, I should not have left hungry. So, if you have s small appetite, this is the place for you.",2
354,"Frozen Yogurt places have been popping up all over New Orleans. It's becoming an over-done craze and also creates a lot of competition for a good review. 

I'd say that the yogurt at Orange Leaf was okay, their flavors weren't very exciting and I was escorted through my samplings.  The server wouldn't just give me tasting cups, she stood by my side and would put the yogurt into the sampling cups that I wanted to try.  Obnoxiously, she would do it one immediately after the other, trying to pass them all into my hands when I was obviously already holding one cup in one hand and my wallet in the other.  She was impatient and rushing me through so I don't even really understand what I tasted.  I do know however, that what I tasted was not as good as the frozen yogurt I've had at other places, like Yogurtland or Plum Crazy.

I think what also annoyed me was that I entered the establishment and waited around inside for about 8 minutes before someone showed up at the front counter.  I actually thought they had closed, but had forgotten to lock the doors.

Did I also mention that it's extremely cold to sit in the store?

So summary? Just okay yogurt, toppings were okay as well, and service was terrible.  Oh wait, almost forgot.  The yogurt consistency is soft, maybe watery.  So expect your yogurt to melt and disappear fast after you put some toppings on.  BTW for some toppings, they force you take a certain amount instead of just a little.",2

356,"Went here yesterday around noon with my beau for some breakfast. I've been going here for pastries since highschool but only had their real food once before. I read some reviews on here and was worried, but they must have read yelp and improved where they were lacking. 

It was busy but we found a table right away! This was a miracle since we drove by three places thinking we would eat there, but the lines were out the door! So we were ecstatic to sit immediately.

Everything on the breakfast menu looked good, we ended up ordering a Denver omlette and eggs Benedict with ham. I do have to say their prices seemed a little high...we were starving so we didn't care that much, but around town the prices are a dollar or two less.

Both our meals were very good, the breakfast potatoes were very awesome! Crispy on the outside and soft enough on inside. Good flavor too. I also love that meals come with a mini pastry. Mmmmm!

For drinks we had a water and a coffee. The coffee was promptly refilled, the waitresses had good attitudes. 

One thing that cracked me up was their descriptions on their menu. It frequently said ""this is great"" or ""best blah blah in town"", ""the best"" or ""so yummy"" it just sounded like an afterthought, like ""oh we should put canned positive words and phrases so people order this."" a more authentic way to boast would be having the servers pick a favorite dish and putting ""so and so's favorite breakfast"" or like what squeeze in does, have a legend where a symbol represents most popular dishes. I frequently ask servers for their recommendations so im not opposed to what they wrote per say, but it made me chuckle.

Will continue going here. We enjoyed our visit!!

Anyway, enjoyed our meal here.",4

Great spot to chill & excellent pic opportunities on the outside deck area!",3

Con: the atmosphere is not great for hanging out, and the food was pretty disappointing. Most of it was burnt. But if you're just coming in for a drink you're golden.",4
359,"Good times and great crowds at Grand Opening over Memorial Day weekend.  Another good addition to the local craft beer scene.  Current beer selections include a wheat, stout, IPA, and seasonal IPA.  And the beers are slightly stronger, ranging from 6.0 to 7.3% ABV.

The ambiance of the taproom is very nice, with wooden interior and large garage doors to give it an airy feel.  There is also a good view on the inside of the fermenters in which the beers are brewed.  One other note on the taproom are the artwork.  The artwork are some of the same as the ones shown on First Fridays.  Think the aim is to use the space to display works from local artists.

I only tried the stout during my visit during Grand Opening, and it had a good flavor w/ coffee undertones.  Hope to make it back to try out the other brews, as well as finding out about new styles that might be coming out.",4
360,"Consider this a 3.5 - as a loyal and by loyal, I mean dangerously loyal customer of The Flying Cupcake I hate to be leaving anything less than 5 stars. (for the record, the location of my residence makes this loyalty inevitable). As of late, I've been disappointed by the new icing ""methods."" By this I mean we went from a 40% frosting/60% 'cake to 18% frosting/82% cake. With the icing not covering the entire surface of the top of the cake, how am I supposed to be certain that each bite of my Here Comes The Bride has a dabble of frosting? ...and with that, this review has taken a turn for the ""first world problems"" category.",3
361,"This place is great! We went twice with our 3 month old - once on a busy Friday night and once during the week and both times they sat us right away - stroller and everything!

The pizza is as close as you'll get to a slice of jersey style pizza. No soggy crust here. The pasta dishes and apps we tried were also very good. The delicious and free garlic knots pretty much guaranteed we were going to have leftovers - which we enjoyed the next day.

Overall, great service and experience - will be back many more times.",5
362,"Schnucks store itself: 3 stars
Schnucks Central Bakery: 0 stars.

This review has nothing to do with the store itself other than the store carries a full line of bakery items baked at Schnuck's own central bakery that are baked with or frosted with hydrogenated oils. I thought a government mandate by the FDA was initiated a couple of years ago with a 3 year compliance that all trans fats (non naturally occuring) are to be removed from all foods by January 1, 2018. Schnucks, on the other hand, are putting the trans fats right back in. I may be anti Walmart but at least they frost their cakes and bake their pies with palm oil. Walmart even ordered their suppliers to quit using trans fats by 2015. What kind of oil is Schnucks currently using to fry their donuts in?  The same hydrogenated oil?  Read the labels (ingredients). Hydrogenated oils can even be found in Schnuck's fresh baked cookies. It's everywhere.  I'm thinking this is nothing short of a cost saving measure by the front office. (nobody else wanted those 5 gallon pails of partially hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil that Schnucks bought on the cheap and are currently stockpiling). In others words, Schnucks cares more about their immediate bottom line than the future health of their customer(s). I thought you guys were better than this. I guess I was wrong. Now where am I supposed to buy my freshly baked goods? Walmart?",2
363,"Great grocery store in the Mid-city neighborhood. It had great deli, soup, hot bar, and salad bar options. It was like a waaaay less expensive Whole Foods. On the weekends they had crawfish or lobster boils by the lbs. This would be my go to store if I lived here for sure. Big plus it's LOCAL!!!

* Fried Chicken was BOMBlicious!!!!",5
364,"Very good NY-style Pizza.  Nothing fancy and very simple.  The crust was cooked just right, and it was done in the correct type of oven.  We'll head back for more when the mood strikes.",3
365,"Immediately upon entering you feel the Latin vibe and ambience. The lights are at a low setting but brighter than dim. There are high top tables and you usual dining size tables. The music is Latin as well.

Each table includes water served out of a wine bottle....very cute yet chic presentation. The menu offers many options to suit all taste buds from pork shank, to salmon, to fried white fish tacos. The appetizers options are just enough with detailed descriptions of the dish. Nice wine and cocktail selection.

The Sangria is nicely made and taste fresh.

Service is attentive, but are in mind any extras or side condiments will be provided at a charge (sour cream, salsa picante, chim sauce, etc)

Overall, it's a great dinner spot for a few girlfriends or a date with a new person. 

I would recommend dressy casual clothes and absolutely no gym shoes.",4

367,"This place is fantastic. I was apprehensive (as I often am walking into bike shops) when I walked in, but quickly realized that this place was different. There were some hard core road bikers in the back talking in their own language, a few weekend warriors getting their bikes worked on and getting gear, and me: an aspiring cyclist intimidated by the prices, lingo, and other details of taking up this pastime.  I normally cringe when I walk into bike stores and feel that if I don't drop 4 grand quickly on a carbon fiber bike or show them the yellow jersey I wore when leading three stages of the Tour de France, that I'll quickly be shown the exit (or a brusque cold shoulder).

At this place, a guy came up and asked what I was looking for and how he could help. I explained my situation: I have a road bike, I want to start using it as my primary means of transportation and for recreation, and I want to get the rest of the equipment that I need. He quickly explained what equipment is NEEDED versus what equipment is NICE TO HAVE. We went through helmets, floor pumps, bike shorts, bike shoes, flat kits, etc. I already have shoes and pedals as well as some tire repair kits. When I told him that, he quickly moved on - never pressuring me to upgrade or to change anything. We talked tire options (tube liners/extra-thick tires/tube sealant), tune up needs, maintenance suggestions, etc.

In the end, I only bought a helmet because I had all of the gear in the NEED category already. As I get going, I'll add the NICE TO HAVE stuff as I see fit. And I'll buy it from Reno Cycling & Fitness because they know how to treat customers. So it is amazing, for a fairly minor purchase, this guy invested nearly half an hour talking to me - never talking down to me. He understood my needs, listened when i talked and helped me immensely.

In a world of diminishing customer service, this place stands out. The depth of knowledge available will not be found in a big box store or at an online discounter. Keep honest, hardworking local companies in business and help yourself in the process.",5
368,"Great happy hour. Perfectly shucked oysters. Seriously, not one grity sea booger and I've ate here countless times. I am huge liver pate enthusiast. Luke has the best I've ever had. I usually go for  oysters, pate, and a few drinks so I can't comment on the entrees. Service is wildly inconsistent. On one occasion it was truly terrible. The manager noticed without us complaining and comped several drinks and dessert.",4
369,Lucky to get one star. Only reason for 1 star was that the beer was cold. The bar staff did not pay attention to anybody at the bar. Came in hoping to get a bite to eat but after ordering a beer the bartender disappeared and never came back. You guys lost a couple of great customers. We travel all over and when we find a new area we pick out our favorite bar and spend a lot of money there. This will not be the place.,1
370,"We will not return to this place. Ordered Fried Green Tomato Sliders and mushroom Swiss sliders!  Bread was cold and hard and most of the sandwich WAS bread!  Meat was flavorless....
Fried Mac n cheese was ok but the onion rings were greasy.  Bill was $39 for two people! Crazy for not good food.  Sorry, Burger Up, we won't be going back.",1
371,"We arrived late after driving through heavy rain and storms. When we came the front desk woman was very friendly and asked us how our trip was. We had a quick check in as I had already done it on the app and we were placed on the SPG member floor which was very quiet and I loved the fact the ice machine was located one floor below. The room was spacious and clean with a jacuzzi tub we didn't use based on all of our travels visiting family and friends. The bed was very soft but supporting, the only down side was only 4 pillows for two of us. One down side was no hairdryer for her. The television gets directv which is a plus because that is what I have but also a down side because I can't watch the Phillies. Our room was refreshed to perfect condition upon our return Saturday. I would definitely stay here again it's quiet and comfortable. I'll try the restaurant next time also",4
372,"One word to describe this place - AWFUL. I ordered take out from here a few weeks ago. It was a Sunday night, around 7 o'clock. They told me to pick it up in 30 minutes (I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato and Maria's sandwich which consists of prosciutto, mozzarella, and tomato). I thought 30 minutes was a little excessive but figured they were probably busy with dinner service. So I arrive to pick up my food about 35-40 minutes later. Not one car in the parking lot, not one person in the restaurant area and I'm told my food is STILL not ready. I ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes for a piece of grilled chicken and a COLD sandwich. The grilled chicken should not take too long on the grill and the other sandwich didn't even require cooking!! The girl at the front desk was not apologetic at all. The cook came out 3 times to talk/flirt with the girls at the front desk. All around it was very unprofessional. 

So I get home to try my sandwich and was not pleased at all. The grilled chicken sandwich was literally a piece of flavorless chicken served on a hamburger bun. Yes, a hamburger bun. The other sandwich was not for me but I had to try it. Again, flavorless. I will not be going back here ever again. For the record, this was probably my 3rd or 4th time ordering from here only due to the fact that it's right down the street from me, and every time I've had to wait a long time for food and/or the food was not good. I've eaten at the other location in Conshohocken before and have been pleased but this location is horrible. Save your time and order elsewhere.",1
373,"The student named above as The Gourmet Pizza Company is being assessed in the following subjects.

AMBIANCE:     B
The student was quiet during a Thursday lunch. (S)He could benefit from a more sociable personality as there was nobody other than Mr. Mark A and his trusted colleague to provide company to this poor student. Otherwise, the student is neatly dressed despite hiding in the shadows of low lighting.

SERVICE:     C
The student's mother was respectful at the register. Not overtly friendly but neither rude nor abrasive either. She gave Mr. Mark A and colleague time to review the menu of what the student had to offer. She took the order and brought out the pizza in a timely fashion. 

FOOD:     B
Fortunately for the student, Mr. Mark A is not terribly picky with his pizza. The Thai Chicken Pizza served up by the student had nice flavor with the peanut sauce drizzled over it. There was a nice proportion of meat and veggies. Mr. Mark A did notice that a gluten-free pizza was an option to be served by the student, however, Mr. Mark A and colleague opted not to go hipster healthy this time around.

Mr. Mark A recommends The Gourmet Pizza Company for promotion to Middle School.",3
374,"I am not from the area, but I do know good food when I have it and let me tell you, this was GOOD FOOD!!. Fried chicken, fried okra and squash casserole all done to perfection.  Dessert was a blackberry cobbler that was almost as good as grandma's (come on, no one beats grandma!), this was the best I have had since.

As we are staying in a hotel, we ordered food to go so that we could have it for brunch tomorrow, I am very excited to get to do it all over again!!

As to the service and the ambience, well, this is my kind of place, mismatched chairs and tables with no pretense at all. The servers are only happy if you are happy, it just doesn't get better than this!",5
375,"Terrible selection, even worse quality. Big mistake. Skip this place. Not worth the price!",1
376,"I stayed there for a convention with about 200 others and had a pretty seamless experience. Self-check in and out is the way to go - super easy and very fast. The rooms were nice and updated, although the formerly-smoking rooms smelled musty and stale (thank goodness mine was in a never-been-smoked-in building. 

The catered meals were good and the service attentive. I did grab a bite at Cafe Milano and was rather disappointed in the bland food and super slow service (even for water refills). I heard the other fine dining restaurants were completely different, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 

I enjoyed a massage at the spa and was very impressed. Their massage tables even gently rumble with the music in the room. If you take in a spa treatment, budget an afternoon of time and enjoy the pools and amenities that come with it. I had a tight window and had to decline. 

The only heads-up: a $13.40-something per day ""resort fee"" added to the bill for everyone staying at the hotel. Not a bankbreaker, but confusing.

If I'm back in Reno without a couch to crash on, I'll definitely head to the Peppermill.",3
377,"I use them frequently and they normally rate a 5, but do not us the phone app to check out.  It froze the computer, and I had to back out, visit the office, asked for a manager, never got one, but the nice guy who did help us out confirmed that the app is unreliable, and to this point no one has explained why.  So just use the PHL National Car Rental but not their phone app.",3
378,"The bf and I have decided that this is our favorite place to go for Vietnamese food in Tucson.  You simply must try the Bahn Mi (#39?) with extra meat!  It's so good that it alone will keep me coming back to this restaurant for years.  The pho is excellent, and you have lots of beef combinations.  (The bf likes it with added crab meat.)  If you're a pho fan, you can't go wrong with this dish.  I like Bun, myself, and I'd say theirs was pretty good.  Go for the extra meat on it.  This time, we tried two of the frozen drinks with the bobo.  The coconut was great, and the bobo balls that you suck up through the straw sort of taste like pieces of soft gummy worms.  Kind of weird, but intriguingly good.  We also tried the avocado, and it's made with REAL avocado (the rest are made with flavored powder.)  It was tasty--kind of creamy, like pistachio ice cream. The Vietnamese coffee is great.  It's sweet, and it only comes in an iced version.  No complaints on a warm day like today.

This place is incredibly affordable.  They also have coupons.  A word of warning--if you are here with a Groupon, try not to go during the last few days that the coupon is valid.  It's a small restaurant, and the place got SLAMMED.  The kitchen couldn't keep up, and the customers could barely contain their irritation. People were impatient; it wasn't their fault--they tried as hard as they could to keep up.  We went with a Groupon early in the promotion, and it was lovely. Logan was our server, and he was great.  

Another caution--they do ""to go"" orders, but if you're looking at an online menu, it's probably not correct.  DON'T order by number, because the numbers on the current menu are all different.  This really messed up a lunch order from my workplace.  Again...our fault and not the restaurant's fault, although I wish they would take a few seconds and upload their menu to their FB page, or something.

THIS PLACE NEEDS A FOOD TRUCK.  NOW.  Those bahn mi sandwiches would make them a fortune.",5
379,"Read the good reviews but we were very disappointed.  Hot and sour soup had a funny taste/smell.  I ordered Kung pao chicken, I don't know if it was chicken, it was so chewy I spit it out.  My husband ordered orange chicken, not the orange chicken we are used to it was like sweet and sour chicken with a ""orange"" sauce.",1
380,I'm a first timer and was excited to stop in here for lunch today. The nuggets and sweet potato fries were overly greasy and soggy. I will not be back.,2
381,"I came here with a group of six friends excited to try something new. We were not very excited about it by the time we got done with our meal. To start off, the lighting at our table made it very hard to see the menu and our food. Once we ordered, the good came quickly which was great. However, the waitress told us the appetizers were family style which to mean means bigger than usual portions that you can share. This was not the case. The portions of the appetizers were just enough to get a small taste. Unless you are a mouse, it will not be enough food. By the time we ordered our food, it was after 9:00, aka ""late night"", which means the portion sizes are smaller. The waiters failed to tell us this before we ordered. I ordered the gnocchi for my main meal. While it was tasty, it was not worth the price. The meals did not come with any sides and if you did want sides they were about $10.00. All-in-all the food tasted good but was overpriced for what you get.",2
382,"Local operated bar with a Wii!!   The last time I played Mario Cart was on my Super Nintendo when I was a wee human.  They also have 25 cent pool table games!  A cheaper place with lots to offer including a full bar with friendly and patient service (we were there recently till 3 in the morning and there was only 4 of us, the bartender could've gone home if we weren't there but didn't pressure us to leave in anyway shape or form).  My only critique was the Bathroom and area surrounding was FILTHY and not in a good way.  I'm forgiving in that sense because we had a blast but it would be nice to have a cleaner environment for my private times.  If you were to research businesses and the biggest mistakes that they can make is Bathroom cleanliness.  People will judge a place naturally without even thinking by the look and cleanliness of a bathroom.  Most Restaurants and bars do bathroom checks frequently and this place looks like they never had one :(  The good thing is I was too wasted to really think about it at the time so I will be back hoping and praying my tinkle time won't be affected by a disgusting restroom.",5
383,"PDQ is Great!!!

PDQ has delicious chicken fingers and the hand cut fries are awesome. The food is very flavorful and you can really taste the quality of the food. I have also tried the Buffalo Tender sandwich, grilled chicken and grilled turkey sandwiches.... All of them are delicious!!!",5
384,"We gave this place a second try, at the request of a family member. 

We went to dinner on a Sunday night, as  a party of 6. This time the appetizers were all in stock, and the only thing they were out of was sweet potato fries - not a big deal. 

We ordered the charcuterie plate and the brussels sprouts for appetizers and they were both great. The only critique I had is that the charcuterie plate came with three cheeses, two meats, and only five small pieces of bread. We immediately asked for more bread, but didn't receive it until our group had eaten 95% of the platter.

I was again disappointed in the dinner. Of the 6 entrees on the menu, four were seafood, one was lamb, and one was beef. Two of us ordered the exact same thing - the 6 ounce beef filet, done medium. One of us received medium, while I received well done. This is twice I've received well done when ordering medium. 

Another member of our party ordered the Depot burger, and didn't receive it until 20 minutes after the rest of our food was brought out, despite everyone ordering at the same time. We made it known that it was unacceptable for him to have to sit there for twenty minutes, while the rest of us had been served. We were finished with our meals by the time his food arrived. I don't know if this was an issue with the kitchen, or with our order not being put in correctly, but I will note that our server wrote nothing down. 

The only saving grace for this place is their bar, with their refreshing and delicious cocktails. Everyone was pleased with their selections, and multiple rounds were ordered. I wish the dining experience lived up to the bar experience, but I don't think we will be giving this place a third chance.",2
385,"I ordered from Chef's Market for a small corporate event. I had the whole process and menu confused, but they(Debbie) worked with me as much as she could to get something that was perfect for my event.

387,"We were assured that a no cheese item would be no problem, and were told they do it all the time.  Went to the self-serve fountain drink area and what we wanted was not working, so we told a staff member.  After waiting for 40 minutes and no food, I got up and asked where it was.  The gal said she would check and I sat back down. She never came to tell us what the issue was, so I ""found her"" and asked.  She said, oh, they made your food with cheese so they are re-making it.  We told another staff member that the soda machine was not working for the drink that we wanted.  We watched MANY MANY people come and go before our food FINALLY arrived.  They sadly never did take the time to fix the fountain drink that was empty.  So we left very frustrated because of all the above.  We were there for ONE SOLID HOUR for a simple lunch in the middle of the week.  Wanted to support the locals........but this was robbery.  Sad.",1
388,"It's an ok place to grab ice cream, shave ice, or coffee, while people-watching at the beach. Pricey. Ice Cream is a product from Working Cow. Coffee and shave ice are somewhat generic. There's an assortment of JellyBelly and other candy. 

The place is pretty dirty. Yeah, I know, it's the beach, but at least wipe down the counter-top, tables, and maybe once a day they could drag a wet mop across the floor. We stopped by two nights in a row and the same sticky spot was on the floor. Restrooms were pretty nasty, too.",2
389,"The food was terrible.  The service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice.  The wine, beer and bar lists are stunning in quality and breadth.

Well, really just one dish was terrible and the others were Okay.  We started with the fried mozerella which was beautifully cook and presented, but seriously lacking in seasoning.  I then had the carpaccio which was absolutely lovely (although this is not a difficult dish to ""cook"", it was perfectly presented.  For our ""mains"" we both ordered small because we have small appetites.  I got a half portion of the butternut squash pasta, which was the day's special.  The filling was nice, the pasta was definately homemade.  But it was presented swimming in olive oil and had a sort of grittiness to it that felt like sand in your teeth.  Burnt cinnamon maybe?  My date ordered the mushroom risotto and his dish was pretty much unedible.  It was possibly the most bland thing I have every tasted and the risotto was woefully undercooked, crunchy.  While you could see it had lots of mushrooms in it, there was absolutely no mushroom flavor.  Not sure if that is quality of ingredients or preparation.  He asked for salt (so confident are they in their dishes that it is not on the table), but no amount seemed to help.

Warning to those who favor quanitity over quality - the potions sizes are QUITE small here.  Half portion really is an appetizer size.  And the appetizers really are appetizers.  Personally I find this highly refreshing as so many italian restaurants seem to be into serving food for five as a single entree and I hate wasting food.",2
390,So I do a lot of conventions Orlando Las Vegas Nashville seems to be the theme however I checked into the Nashville Gaylord and can't even get a charge by my bed however I did fix it by changing the lamp from the desk to the one by my bed that has an outlet how hard is that this is not a huge Convention it's a little smaller than the ones that I usually go to. Stayed in a lot better rooms at the same exact price you have to give a discount for the ones that are not accommodated yet or remodeled,1

392,"I love this place. It's awesome for takeout on a weekday, and it's nice to have a Thai place in North County. I love all the noodle stir fry's. I recommend the banana wontons served with honey- They are on the appetizer menu but are great for dessert! I also really enjoy the sweet potato appetizer. The restaurant definitely lacks any ambience, but it has some really great food and is worth stopping by on a regular basis.",4
393,I've never been a huge fan of this place but my husband likes it. We went today for a late lunch and I got the hummus and pita for an app and the tossed Greek salad. The hummus was really yummy and the salad was very fresh and was a large serving. I couldn't finish it all so I took it home for tomorrow. Next time he wants to come here I know what I'll be getting - the tossed Greek salad!,4
394,"A group of seven of us came here for the Sunday Night dinner for 30 dollars. It's really not worth it if you are more than two people. All of us pretty much left starving. We're fixing snacks as we type. The dinner is served family style and we noticed that they would give the same portions (1 dish) to a table for two to a table of four. There were seven of us and they gave us only 2 small portions of each dish plus a chicken each (thank god for the latter). They could have easily given us another dish seeing as 1 dish =  1 table for 2. The whole thing came across as a bit too thrifty on their side and was not an all together positive dining experience. The table of four next to us also audibly complained when they got the same amount of food as the couple right next to them.

BASICALLY:  7 people shouldn't be getting only twice the food TWO people are getting
and it seems cheap, shifty and just disrespectful to do it that way and charge everyone the same amount. Did I say we all left hungry? 

Having said that, our server was very attentive and the sliver of food was good. If you plan on doing this, do it as a date for two TOPS and not as a get together for friends because you'll all be heading out and spending more money from how hungry you'll be.",2
395,Great hotel! Customer service was excellent and the decor was beautiful! This is my second time in a Kimpton Hotel and I would highly recommend it if there's one in your city. Second one with no pool though...,4
396,Good selection. Good service. It can get noisy. It's more of a bar atmosphere on Friday and Saturday. It isn't the place for me.,1
397,This is okay for a coffee shop.  It's a bit crowded near the ordering counter.   Seating down stairs is also a little cramped but there's a whole second floor with lots of room.  Free wi-fi.  Goes for an antique-y interior but to me they missed the mark and things are just old and need a little updating.,3
398,"After driving pass all the seafood restaurants around Clearwater Beach, I knew wanted seafood right there and then. I wasn't familiar with the area and did not do any yelping before hand, so was pretty hesitant to just blindly pick a restaurant.  Finally, after a long day at the beach, we made a quick walk across the street to all the restaurants and thats when we stumbled into Crabby Bill's. We ordered the $25 bucket of steamed seafood. It was decent, not necessarily the best fresh seafood. This was just a quick snack that I shared with one other person to keep us going before our big dinner at Bern's Steak House that we had reservation for a couple hours later.",4
399,"My husband and I are sushi junkies. We absolutely love it and could eat it multiple times a week without batting an eye. Where we live, we get some pretty good sushi, but it's nothing like the sushi we had when we ate at IRB Sushi. Holy smokes it was delicious! Often here in Cincinnati, we often treat ourselves to sushi when the few places around here offer half-priced sushi deals on certain nights of the week. For the price and quantity we had here, it blows every single place we go to locally, right out of the water. The fish was delicious and fresh, the rolls were beautifully crafted, it was truly an enjoyable meal and we both enjoyed every single bite we had. For the two of us to have 5 rolls, and two house salads, the damage was a mere $53. We looked at the bill and our jaws just dropped. That's such an inexpensive tab for the meal that we had. The server we had was great, she was attentive, and kept our drinks filled, despite being completely busy. My only concern was the amount of open space in the actual restaurant felt a little... empty. Like they could have fit at least 3 or 4 more 4-top tables in. That would have eliminated the need to wait for 30 minutes like we had to when we first arrived. 

This was our first trip to IRB, but I know when we come back, we're going to be going to IRB Sushi again!",4
400,"Wanted to like this place but was disappointed. 
The building and decor are nice. The service was good but the food was the let down.

401,"Reserved a car for my boss' business trip. I reserved well in advance a mid-size car which was the same price as economy with the bigger name places.

Not worth the hassle!",2
402,"Wow, I've been hearing a lot about this place and I'm happy I finally did decide to stop in. It was super busy for a Wednesday night but it was so so yummy. Definitely worth the wait. The fish tacos were delicious, you won't be disappointed!",5

404,"So, I had a craving for a slinger and used Yelp to help find a local place to get one, leading me to George Rivolo's Diner. I walked in and was amazed at how small the place was. I counted around 15 seats total. The seats were a bit worn down and could have definitely used some cushions (I actually did hurt my butt sitting down on those things). I browsed through the menu, found my singer (and was disappointed at the up charge to have meat in it). So I watched as the lady behind the counter made my food.

While waiting I have to point out how immaculately clean the kitchen was. Having worked in several restaurants I know how much work it takes to keep a kitchen as spotless as this place was and I have to say that alone impressed me and told me that the people who own this place care. 

Once I got my food I figured, ""yep... that's a slinger"". I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more chili on it, and I felt that the chili and burger meat could have done with some seasoning. However that being said, it was okay for diner food. Not something I'd go out of my way for, but not something I'd avoid either. If the owner took the time to add a bit more flavor to the food this would be a place worth visiting regularly for me. As it stands though, i can't really give high recommendation for this place unless you are already in the neighborhood and craving some diner food.",3
405,"Came across this restaurant from my news feed on Yelp and bookmarked it for a later date. Well it was dinner night and my wife and I decided to choose this place for the night. The restaurant is kind of in the middle of nowhere but don't let it fool you- the food is great.

We were waited on by a new girl who had just started that was very sweet and nice. We both had a lobster roll but mine was cold and my wife had a hot one which were both excellent in their own way. I thought the price was high though for what you get. We also shared the chowda which was probably the best we have had and that was worth every penny!

We noticed another table having the twin sisters which were 2 lobsters with fixings which seemed great for the price which we will try next time. 

Don't know how often we will come here as the prices are high but you get quality food!

You can also purchase lobsters and other seafood here also if you would like to make it at home.",5
406,"One thing to know about this place is that you'll definitely get your monies worth, portions wise. I was impressed with the scrimp scampi portion I received that came with a choice of salad (which was also a nice portion).

My only major critique is that the shrimp in my scampi were slightly undercooked/seasoned. Since the shrimp make up a big part of the dish, that was a slight disappointment.

Because the portions I got were so big I was able to take them home with me and they were nice leftovers.

Despite one pitfall with the shrimp, I would be willing to try them out again.

I'm giving them a two for now. However, I do plan to visit again and possibly do a re-review.",2
407,"I found this center to be very honest, ethical, and competent.

408,"We have made khyper one of our must go when we are in town. We often go several times during our time in Philly just because it has such a cool vibe. I would give this place a 5 but we had a really weird experience with 2 of their bar backs on New Years. They were pretty rude to a couple of Mummers in costume. Probably upset bc they where throwing confetti- but come on, its new years and its Philly for goodness sake....

Any way- nice, really nice selection of beers. They make a lovely Pimm's cup my most fave drink right now. I don't care how cold it is outside, this drink makes me think of happy times... Tried their wings recently and they were a repeat. 

If you are in the area, make sure to stop by. I need to make sure to try their brunch next time we are in town- seems like it is very popular. 

Go enjoy. You won't regret it.",4
409,"I am disappointed with the turkey sub.  It tastes like cheap lunch meat.  I could have made this sub myself and for nearly $5 this isn't worth it.  Unfortunately this place has lost stars in my eyes due to the lack of quality with the turkey.  I will try this place again, but will never eat their turkey again.  I honestly would rather go to subway since there is a variety of sauces and bread, which makes this chain a better value for your money.  This place isn't horrible, I think I made a bad selection and will probably try their pastrami next time.",2

416,Favorite breakfast & coffeehouse! Great service always! I visit here at least once a week. The healthy bagel is highly recommended & he has the best fresh teas!!,5
417,"Food was awful!!!!! Tarter sauce tasted old, gumbo tasted like air freshener, and even the salad was horrible, payed way too much for food that was uneatable, very bad experience",1
418,I cannot say enough about this place!! It's the greatest thing to ever happen to northeast Philadelphia. There is nothing like it around!!! I am there at least once a week and have never been disappointed. The food is always fresh. The menu is creative and innovative. Whether you order off the menu or try one of their specials. You won't be disappointed. They treat my husband and I like family. The staff is so friendly. Johnny cakes Obrien always takes great care of us. If you haven't tried it yet. You should get there as soon as possible!!!,5
419,"Just had a ""ramen"" delivered... All I'm going to say is, you're better off eating the instant ramen soup! First time I tried this place and I'm sure it will be the last.",1
420,"The hibachi is delicious and everyone is friendly. There are HH specials Monday through Friday which makes it very reasonable (avg $16) and includes salad, soup, rice, noodles and your choice of meat and veggies. The hibachi chef is also entertaining.",4
421,"Great, large portions of food with live music.  Margaritaville is a fun, beachy place with food ranging from fish tacos ($17) to burgers ($16.)  The music is good if  a bit loud.  Service was excellent.  You can people watch from the window tables and they angle to let in a nice breeze.  Lunch is a bit high, but that may be the area pricing as well.  Live music pours from all of the establishments along Broadway.  Nice lunch place!",3
422,"This taco joint is highly rated on yelp so I gave it a try last night for the first time. I was a bit disappointed in my selections, maybe some of the other menu options were better but I wasn't thrilled with what I chose. When you come in, you place an order and pay, then they bring the food to the table for you. It isnt a full wait service, something inbetween since you do help yourself to beverages and condiments etc. There have a wide selection of bottled beers, as well as margaritas and mixed drinks. I had read a review stating the margs were $3, but they were $5.95 last night and I didnt see any advertisement for happy hour or anything for the weekdays-which was a disappointment.

All the tacos are soft shell only, which I guess is more authentic, but not what I prefer. I did the daily special which was a chicken verde and also did a bean/vegetarian taco. The chicken taco was overcooked and dry, and the tortilla was wet and soggy from the verde sauce, which I did not like. The ingredients seemed fresh but overall it was just not working for me. The bean taco was much better but still left something to be wanted.

I will say the the chips/guac/queso we ordered was awesome so thats a 5 star in my book but not enought to make me want to go back for food. if they had a happy hour I think it would be a fun place to hangout with friends for a drink and some chips.",3
423,"Run by amateurs! They need Robert or Chef Ramsey to teach these amateur how to run a restaurant! Not only I waited 30 minutes to get my order I waited another 30 to get my food and it was the wrong order! Waited another 15 for my family's food. We were seated after 738 and didn't leave til 945pm.  Granted we meet the co-owners daughter waiting for a table so I figured, food must be really good for even she has to wait for a table. Service was 1 star. Not even a refill of water? Our waiter need to go to real restaurant to see how real waiter wait. 
Now the food? If it arrived hot and not cold? If it arrived all at one time? If the staff worked as one instead of standing pretending to work? Maybe!

I was disappointed! Most of the reviews here noted service was so, so..they weren't lying! The food was good I have to say but so is Appleby's on a bad day.",2
424,"Convenient to downtown and displaying Irish decor, Paddywagon Irish Pub is suitable place to drink during any day or occasion. Strictly a bar, they have a full liquor selection and a variety of draughts and a slew of whiskeys that are sure to please even the pickiest of alcohol drinkers. In addition, the bar houses a cigar case for those who like to light up while drinking when the mood strikes them.
 
The bar has an outside covered patio which is nice for enjoying the lovely Florida weather. I always appreciate a bar where I can sit outside and people watch and get some fresh air. With the bar being at the base of the high rise residential Element, there is surely a good amount of people watching to occur. There is metered street parking or if you visit on the weekend, you're in luck: free on street parking in metered spots. 

The bar has pool tables and dart boards as well as TV trivia for the guests entertainment. There are well, beer, and martini specials everyday during their happy hour from 12-7pm. I would be sure to ask your bartender about the offerings, as they are not readily posted. 

If hunger strikes when you are there, there is a list of local restaurants and food options in the area, and those that deliver are marked. Duckweed Urban Market is a few doors down and you can get quick snacks or prepared meals from there. 

All in all, I enjoyed my pleasant experience at the bar. Knowledgeable staff, the decor, and the crafted drink were a hit in my book. It might be worth noting that Paddywagon won the award for the best Bloody Mary from the 2015 Bloody Mary festival this year. Props to them and this nice addition to the downtown scene.

It might be important to note that on this particular occasion it was a rainy, stormy day and we popped in during an odd-off time, like around 3:30pm on a Saturday so that is why there were few bar patrons as pictured. There were more people there then as depicted.",4
425,"I actually received pretty good service when I came here one evening. To me, the real problem with Sears is the hardware section isn't as big or as complete as it used to be. Most of Sears has now been taken over by the softer side of Sears and thus, it's no longer of much use to me since I can get clothes at lower prices pretty much anywhere else.",2
426,"I bought a living social deal here and with all the great reviews I thought I couldn't pass up the deal. I definitely should have. 
First off, I drove by the sketchy house turned nail salon and thought...there is no way I am getting my nails done here. It looks incredibly unprofessional from the outside. However, again, due to the good reviews and since I had already paid for the deal, I figured what the heck! The looks of the inside do make up for the outside, but the service did not. I received the worst pedicure I've ever gotten. The nail polish was literally poured onto my toes. I immediately drove up to Flagstaff after the appointment and even after the 4 hour drive there were spots that hadn't dried yet! I ended up just taking it all off at that point and painting them myself.
I also got the shellac manicure. This did come out better than the pedicure, however the color that I picked and the color that was put on my nails was definitely not the same. Usually shellac can last at least 2-3 weeks...this lasted about a week and a half before it started chipping off. 
Needless to say, I would never go back.",1
427,"I walked into this place and immediately felt the need to drink a Guinness. Luckily, they had it on tap so I got one. This place is small, dark, and has a very hole in the wall style feel. Definitely a soccer bar. We had lunch with a group of 6 on a Tuesday and the place was full. The menu has all your typical pub food options. We all got different things and I'd say the fish and chips is the best thing on their menu. In summary, the food was good, but not great. To me this place seem more like a place where you come to have a couple drinks and watch a game.",3
428,"Stopped in here Sunday nite with my family after a long day at the Franklin Institute. There were six of us and there were tables for six in the rear of the place, all with reserved signs on them. What's with that? We might have walked out if someone hadn't wandered over. We sat at the middle table which was a mistake as water from the AC vent above was dripping on my daughter, so we moved to the side table. The bartender came right over and we ordered drinks. Lots of nice craft beers on their list. The waiter finally came over and took our orders. Skip the chicken wings as they were very tiny and overdone, but the calamari was super tender and delicious.
I ordered their half pound burger which was very good. They could work on the fries to get them more crispy. Everyone liked their food and we would go back. Service was friendly, attentive but somewhat pokey, but after reading some reviews, we expected that and it was not a problem. Neat place!",4
429,"The espresso here is excellent. My favorite place to come for an Americano. The staff is polite and friendly and vibes are mellow. It is important to know that there is no access to power outlets, but unlimited wifi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are always clean.",4
430,"Good tour of the facilities, it doesn't compare to the St. Louis Brewery, but definitely worth the trip if you live around the area. Decent selection of free samples after tour.",4
431,"FINALLY!! st. louis has a place at which i look forward to eating when i am visiting!!

i have been here twice and there is just no competition. the food is delicious, fresh, (dare i say?) even a little challenging! which we love. people reviewing here who didn't love the food are not adventurous. so, if you're not that type, try some place on the hill where you can drown your blown-out tastebuds in marinara or a nice mediocre alfredo sauce.
the cocktails are perfect. everything we ate was perfect. and we left feeling sated but not overfed, as is often the case at places in the midwest.
the last time we ate at here was the day after xmas, and we're STILL reminiscing. :)
i love that they only accommodate groups of four or less. this really adds to the general charm of the place and speaks to the quality of the food. clearly, they're taking their time and making every dish perfect back in the kitchen, which you just cannot do when a table of eight tromps through. the dishes on the menu are made for sharing, and are the perfect size for 3 or 4 people, so it makes sense in this way too. it also means that the noise level is low. 
it's such a refreshing break from all the other utterly characterless food in st. louis.",5
432,"Fantastic little BYOB! The Antipasto Salad and Gnocchi were excellent. Contrary to some other reviews about the crowded seating, I thought it was rather spacious. There are other BYOB's in Philadelphia that are much smaller. I will be back here again soon.",4
433,"I am glad I waited to review Barrio until my second dining experience, as the food was WAY better. When they first opened, a friend and I went to Barrio for lunch and split the seafood tostada and the fry bread trio. In my opinion, the seafood had way too much mayo or a wet white sauce. Of the three fry bread ""tacos"", the chile con carne was my favorite, followed by the calabacitas and chicken with pico. It is pretty pricey for the small portions. So with that, I wasn't too excited to go back, but am glad I did!!

A group of us went for dinner last night. We got there early and enjoyed some happy hour drink and food specials at the bar. I was excited to know that happy hour is even on Saturday, from 3-6pm. During happy hour, Blue Moon and Dos Equis are $3, premium cocktails are $5, including margaritas. All tapas are $2 off, so we had the bacon wrapped jalapenos ($6 for 3 during happy hour) and the chorizo-queso with chips ($7 during happy hour), the later being pretty tasty. We were later seated for the dinner (via opentable reservation). Given my experience with lunch, I opted for the chili con carne again, yet this time as an entree (see picture). I used to be a vegetarian, so this was a pretty gutsy order for me, but I am glad I did as the meat was very flavorful. All entrees are served with either soup or salad (both very small) and rice or beans. The tepary beans were excellent. My entree was also served with fry bread and a side of calabacitas. Another standout was the pineapple habenero margarita (see picture).

Overall, its a beautiful large space that serves high quality, albeit small portions.",4
434,"One star is for the rudeness, not honoring their words and high cost. My dad went their and got his smog check but didnot pass. The guy charged him ~$30 and said next time after he gets the problem fix, he would only charge ~$15. So my dad got the problem fixed, come back, another guy charged him $22. I wasnt there, my dad doesnt speak English so he called me and gave the phone to talk to this guy (on Aug 15, 2017). I explained the situation and he said he can not do that, hes the only one there, everyone was on vacation and then just hung up when I did not finish talking yet. He was very rude on the phone. Their price is way too high. Even their ""discount"" price is higher than other places. If you need a smog check, GO TO G K Smog INSPECTION on 1960 E 2nd St, Reno, NV 89502. They are very nice there and only charge $16",1
435,"They claim to be open until 11:00 on Friday's. Came tonight at 10:25 and the door was locked, hostess shrugged and mouthed they were closed. This early on a Friday!? Horrible business practice. I've been coming here at least twice a month after dinner in the city. So annoyed by this occurrence- I will not be back!!",1
436,"The restaurant is okay. Came here with a group on the school's wallet, so I can't comment on how much the food was. It seemed fairly reasonable. Nothing was all that memorable, service and portions were decent. It's a bit removed from the group of restaurants by Rittenhouse, so it's a bit unfortunate that it has a mediocre location. 

I do want to note that the banana bread pudding for dessert was very delicious! Would order that again if I ever come back!",3
437,"We waited for 1 1/2 hours to be seated which is fine considering they told us that when we put our names down, but after being seated we waited 45 min for our food to come which is ridiculous. The food was very good. The biscuit was soft and yummy, but no meal is good when you have to wait as along as we did.",3
438,"Quirky, cute, homey friendly and good coffee / tea!  What more could you want in a local place.  They aim to please and have many regulars.  They have a limited selection of muffins and quiche which I did not try.  The tea is loose leaf and brewed when ordered.  They have a ""bar"" set up with stools, a sitting area with couches and chairs and outdoor seating.  If you drink in they give you a mug, no mugs match they are eclectic and vary in size - it is part of what makes the place fun.  They have art work all over the walls and quotes that will have you inspired or laughing.  Some of my colleagues had the Elvis which was a coffee roasted with banana and peanut flavorings.  They have every milk/non-milk option.  The prices are decent too.  They are also pet friendly.  I have already told 3 friends they should check it out and now all of you.  Enjoy!",5
439,Had a Habebero Bowl.  It was tasty and a good portion for the price.Hubs has Tamales and he said they were very good. They have a nice salsa bar as well. Only real ding I give them is that their guacamole was not very good. It was almost like it might have had mayo in it....YIPES!!!Guacamole also had a lot if onion in it.  I am a purest when it comes to guacamole. Atmosphere was nice and clean. Seems Family ran establishment. I give them extra credit for that.,4
440,I'm not a vegetarian.  I eat a paleo diet.  And I was able to get a lunch that filled me up for hours.  I'll gladly come back here.,5
441,"This hotel is bad, borderline mediocre. Of course, the hotel remains in construction which is an inconvenience, but manageable. The front desk is located on the tenth floor which makes it difficult to get help quickly. Room floors are inaccessible without a room key in the elevator. This wouldn't be an issue had the keys actually worked half the time (we had to get 5 new room keys). The elevators come once per hour and are almost always full, so you might as well get some exercise and take the stairs. The pool seemed too vacant (probably because the ""front"" desk was right in front of it). The rooms were quaint as they served their purpose, a place to sleep. Definitely not luxurious, but towels/soap were always cleaned and replaced. Our AC unit was faulty and we had to call for the hotel engineers to be fixed, but it remained operational after. Overall, horrible service and facility, but the rooms themselves are adequate. Location's great, in the heart of the French Quarter. I'd only suggest staying here to save some money to spend on the delicious restaurants.",2
442,"After reading the reviews, we had high expectations.  We arrived at 5pm on Saturday evening to a packed brewery.   We were told the wait was an hour.  There were tables in the bar and we waited until we were able to snag one. Unfortunately, the bar menu is not the same as the dining menu.  We ordered chips and stuff to munch on while we waited.   The chips, guacamole, and puréed bean salsa were actually the highlight of our meal.   I ordered a beer.  Beware, there are no traditional beers here.  They only sell what is made in the brewery.   They also do not sell soda.  My kids had ice tea which was extremely bitter.  Too bad the bartender has not mentioned this to me.   
The real disappointment was the fish tacos.  As previous people have stated, Where Is The Fish????  I felt like I was eating nothing but breading.   At $12 for two tacos, I expect more then fried batter.   I also expect red cabbage cole slaw on a fish taco.  Our waitress was nice and so was the host. Not a place I would ever eat at again.   I am actually surprised at the high ratings.   My daughter and her friend had the hummus appetizer which they said was pretty good.",2
443,"A good BBQ spot at an affordable price on Street Rd.  My wife and I decided to give this place a try after reading the rave reviews.  A few things to keep in mind before trying this restaurant out.  The restaurant is in the Best Western hotel, not even in the front, you need to awkwardly head to the back of the joint to find the place.  At first glance it looks like a little dive bar.  We visited at 8:30PM on a Saturday night so our experience may have been out of the norm.  We actually missed the turn because the sign is so small it's easy to miss.  Worse, if you miss the turn you need to drive at least a half mile if not further to turn around (if you're headed towards Feasterville-Trevose that is).  

We were greeted by Julie.  Our first thought as we watched her run both the bar and attend to the floor was, seriously?  This place with such great reviews is being run by one person?  Julie is actually a true gem, personable and went out of her way to get everyone's name that comes into the place.  If you do meet her ask about her trip to Chile but wait until after you've eaten already ;)

As for the food.  I really wanted to give this place 5 stars however there were just too many things that went wrong.  Keep in mind, we showed up 30 minutes before the kitchen closes so our experience may be different from others.  I will say, the coffee rubbed brisket was delicious!  My wife got the Kielbasa sandwich however unfortunately it was cold and just didn't look palatable.  We ordered the Pulled Pork spring rolls as an appetizer.  Unfortunately we only received 2 small rolls and they were cold on the inside.  The sides were good but not great although the hush puppies were also cold on the inside.  Like I said our timing may have been the biggest influencer there.  The portions of the meal were very fair.  I saw some reviews about the portions being small but the brisket was about as much as any healthy person would want in any one sitting.  

The service wasn't bad, Julie was very welcoming and did a good job being she was running things by herself but if the management is reading this having another employee would help give the place a more favorable appearance.  With all this said the brisket was good enough that I'd come back again but next time I'll try to come when the food probably hasn't been sitting out too long.  One last note I didn't try the ribs because to this day I haven't had better ribs than Chicken Holiday which is in Langhorne/Levittown near the Oxford Valley Mall.  I'll try these ribs at some point and hopefully will revise my rating upwards, overall the place is worth a try at the least.",3
444,"I would give this place a 4-5 star for our 4 night stay. However one thing really put me off. On the 2nd night, a huge cock roach runs across as we open the door to our room. Gross. Can't find it. On the 3rd day, there were 2 huge cock roaches just chilling on the floor towel. I can't imagine staying there if I had to get rid of the cockroaches myself. 

PROS:
- Unique space, smeg fridge, great shampoos, love the furniture
- Good location, within walking distance to the French Quarter but away from the crowds
- Staff were friendly

CONS:
- Definitely a party hotel. Every night there would be people at the bar or lounge
- Only one way to really enter the hotel besides the coffee shop next door
- Elevators are kind of old and can take a while
- Pool gets packed with people who aren't guests - made it uninviting as a hotel guest
- Strong odor, smelled like paint and something else",3
445,"You know when you go to place, have an ok meal and then you forget it exists? That is Ants Pants Cafe: forgetable. 

I don't know why I forgot Ants Pants the first time. I think I enjoyed my food and the service was fine. I think it was that Ants Pants was merely unexceptional. 

Today, a friend suggested Ants Pants. I thought, ""Oh yeah. That place."" We wandered over from my job and had a very late brunch. I had two eggs and my friend had a salad. Both plates were good, but nothing struck a chord. There should be something you tell your friends with relish or with venom. There should be something that sticks out about a place. The atmosphere at Ants Pants wreaks of BLAH. 

I can say that whoever designed Ants Pants is a genius of spatial planning. For a place so small , they smanage to fit 24 seats well enough. But should seating charts spring to mind for where you go for brunch? 

No. Very Blah.",2
446,"I went there for dinner while in the Tampa area and had a great meal.   They have multiple Vegan and Vegetarian options, while also having a full bar with Guinness.   Very unusual across the good ole USA.

The place is in an interesting area, which seems it could be a little rough in the dark, so if you go, I would recommend going during the light hours.

The bartenders are really nice, and helpful with picking a good dish.",4
447,"This is a review of this particular store, not David's Bridal as a whole. We purchased bridesmaids gowns here bc of convenience and price; but the staff in this store is blatantly rude. We've been in here three or four times - and each time was more unpleasant. If you can find another store, I would.",1

449,"The food here is ok, but the management doesn't seem to care about it's customers.  I tried this place using a deal I bought off dealchicken.com, but they refused to honor it.  The manager simply refused to honor the full value, saying there were some special terms of the deal that weren't printed on it.  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to know about those special terms, but the manager seemed to think I should know.  I was astounded by the lack of courtesy and general professionalism.  This is hands down the worst treatment I have ever received as a customer.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, in any regard. Ever.",1
450,"There are too many great places to eat in New Orleans for LUKE to deliver such uninspired food and inattentive service. It was the only disappointment we had on a great food weekend.

The Burger is also good and a safe choice.",1
451,"We were so excited to try this place - advertised a great menu and live music. When we got there on a Friday night it was dead. There were only 2 other couples in there and the ""live"" music was a saxophonist playing over recorded music. The Sax was so loud that we couldn't even hear each other. We didn't stay for the food. The bartender was nice and attentive though.",2
452,"My family and I have been a patron of Sparkle since their first car wash in Penndel. I've always received great service until today. The manager was rude and almost broke off my car door handle, I guess she wasn't patient enough to let me unlock the door. Then grimaced at me when I said ""hello, how are you?"" I was being smug but still. Then I had to ask for a rag to clean off salt that was on my interior door near the window. If I'm cleaning my interior what am I paying them for? Never again.",1

It seems the good reviews they receive come from sales...DUH! If I was making money I would kiss butt also. Just wait until after your car is in your hands and something is wrong, these guys don't give a crap about the customer which is always the problem with big companies, they laugh at the little guy once there is trouble. 

Take a look at the BBB reports (they have 13 complaints against them) I wish I had checked it out before I bought my truck there. The mechanics are either clueless or they sabotage vehicles on purpose so you have to go back.  I will say one thing for sure...I WILL NEVER buy a car or truck from them again and would NEVER recommend this place to anyone! I will most likely never buy a Nissan again...My experience has left such a bad taste in my mouth, I am going with a Toyota!!!!!! 

I am so frustrated I could just spit.",1
458,"First of all, Asian Kitchen is in a great location, the Seabreeze Plaza at US 19 and Curlew. As you enter the place, you will notice how clean it is. The menu is fairly standard. Take out and eat in are offered. I've had the Beef Lo Mein, the Hot & Sour soup, egg rolls and Beef with Oyster sauce over several visits. At the very least all the food is very flavorful. The Hot & Sour soup was outstanding! I was a little disappointed in the amount of meat in the Beef with Oyster Sauce but otherwise it was very good. The staff is pleasant and very efficient. I plan to work my way through the menu over time.",4
459,"This hotel is located near the Tampa International airport.  I stayed here last week and have stayed here several times over the past 8 years.  This Embassy Suites is not like most Embassy Suites as it does not have the center atrium.  The hotel is a standard high rise building.  

Bad - Parking at this hotel is a challenge.  They have a small garage and the parking spots are very small with extremely tight turns.  If you want to prevent getting your doors dinged, don't park in the garage.  Also, there is no elevator in the multi-story parking garage.  So plan on dragging your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. 

Good - As with all Embassy Suites they put out a good breakfast spread with cooked-to-order eggs, omelettes and pancakes.  Also, the employees at this hotel are very friendly.

In summary, I find the parking situation to be unacceptable and I will choose a different hotel when returning to Tampa.",2

461,"Same office and doctor as another Yelp directory listing, just a different phone #.  I'd like to make sure others don't get sucked into this miserable office.

If you want to go to a dentist in a ghetto where there is risk of getting mugged...  If you want to be worked on with equipment from the 80s...  And most importantly, if you require a dentist that wants to do the minimal amount of work possible in order to get paid by your insurance company... come to Dr. Marcus.  I was new to Philly and looked on ZocDoc for recommendations, and found this place.  What a disaster.  Lesson learned - don't trust ZocDoc outside of NYC.  Waiting room full of scary people.  30 minutes after my appointed time, I finally got in.  Almost wanted to walk out then with all the dated equipment.  Cleaning was cursory, at best.  No flossing, no detailed scaling.  What did I just pay for??  And then, normal dentists give you floss, an Oral-B toothbrush and some toothpaste sample.  Nope, not here.  A plastic baggie with one of those toothpick-flosser combo widgets.  Seriously?

Best part yet - 3 months later, I call back to schedule a regular cleaning.  I've paid for my insurance, and it covers 6 cleanings a year.  I might as well use it, right?  Dr. Marcus refuses to schedule me in!!  Can you believe that?  ""Your teeth are clean, they don't require a cleaning.""  It's a patient's call if they want a polish or not.  And it wasn't like she had a packed schedule.  Her receptionist offered several time slots under Dr. Marcus intervened.  Gruff and ill-mannered.  A ghetto dentist.

Oh, and if you decide to transfer dentists and want your x-ray records from Marcus - another $20 for a 'copy fee'.  WTF?  I've been going to Dentists in Boston, NYC and Miami for over 10 years, and I've never been asked for that.  Save the headaches, look for another dentist.",1
462,"I really don't get the lack of love for this place.  Ok, maybe it's not crazy cheap, but I hardly think their prices are out of line.  I think that you'll enjoy this store much more if you don't think of it as a thrift store.  It's somewhere between thrift and vintage.  Thiftage?  Yes, thiftage.  Plus, it's spacious, has a huge selection, and is eminently shoppable.  I'm sorry, but I'm willing to pay a couple bucks extra for a store that gives me a pleasant shopping experience.  Not to mention the friggin fact that usually at least one item that I find has the magical 50% off cutout, making it all the more reasonable.

And who is complaining about the staff?  They're always nice to me, even though I act like a slow person every time I get to the cute boy at the register!

Come here.  Marvel at the color organization.  Get sexified.  Ignore the haters.

      If you are looking for a Saturday afternoon spot to have a good lunch outside.... this is a near perfect place.",4

466,"obviously for the price it isn't going to be the best hotel ever BUT when we walked into our room for the first time it smelt so musty, a bit like cigarette smoke and the shower wasn't clean. Also, the cleaning people never came to our room and emptied the trashes or gave us new towels, we had to ask for new towels a couple times. they ended up charging us an extra $100 without telling us because we had to put some of our trash next to the trashcan because like i said, they never came to empty it. the only reason I gave it two stars was because the free breakfast wasn't terrible. One last thing, the trains are SO loud and non stop. all we could hear majority of the time.",2
467,"I want to love this place, I really do. One the surface, the atmosphere is good, the ingredients seem top notch, and the pizza selections well chosen. But every pie I had has been to cold and floppy to really win me over.",3
468,"This place is overrated. 4.5 stars on yelp should say something about this place. Went here for dinner with some friends and everything tastes average. The best thing  on the menu is the ca phe sua da, but really, you can get great coffee at any other place. Not to mention the atmosphere and environment. It's too small and tight thats its very uncomfortable to enjoy dinner.",1
469,"In the day - when they first opened, it was great.  The quality of food and service have faltered greatly in past few months though.  The bar? - great...drinks are always spot on.  The food?  meh - not worth the prices.",2
470,"this is exactly what the doylestown area needed - a bar and grill that isn't tiny and overpriced and isn't a crappy chain restaurant. they have TONS of beers, and you can get any of the ones on tap in a pitcher.  there are large TVs around the dining area so it would be a great place to watch a game. the food is tasty and very reasonably priced. i ordered a pork panini and i loved it. (pork loin, bacon, provolone, and mixed greens with a balsamic sauce. muy tasty.) i'm looking forward to going here not only to hang out at the bar, but at the outdoor patio as well.",4
471,"I was in Clearwater on vacation with my teenage son and paid a visit to the PF on Rt 19.  The first few days we went the staff was pleasant and although the gym was smaller than the PF back home, it was adequate.  However yesterday we walked in and were about to sign in at the main desk when a female staff interrupted another staff talking with us and stated that my son wasn't allowed to work out since we were from out of state.  I explained that another staff told us it was ok, but she got attitude and then proceeded to tell us that the only way my son could work out was if he paid $20 for a day pass.  Needless to say I was pissed off and won't be returning.  It's rather sad that they couldn't make a small concession to satisfy their customers.  As I said before, the gym is small but decent - especially for $10/month...",2
472,"This place honestly was a disappointment! Very thin cuts of meat for the price compared to other places. The food came out cold too. Had the Dolsot Bibimbap and the stone pot was cold to the point I could've picked it up and not get burned. 

When you order a dolsot bibimbap of any kind, the rice at the bottle should be able to get crunchy....nope not here. 

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, please save your money and go somewhere else.",1
473,"5 stars for Doylestown Thai food.  If you're looking around for thai food in this area look no further.

I've lived in NYC and San Fran and have eaten quite a bit of great thai food.  This place is as good as thai food that you'd find in San Fran and NYC at a non-upscale thai restaurant.

The service is great and very child friendly.  Parking in downtown can be a little difficult at times but worth it after you've eaten the drunken noodle, chicken with green beans and the massaman curry.

The pineapple fried rice was delicious but the drunken noodles were the best.  All the right flavors with a touch of heat.  The pad thai was a little too heavy on the palm sugar and too sweet for me.  I prefer my pad thai with more fish sauce, chili powder and egg.

The massaman curry is quite nice and will be going back over and over again.

This place is a BYOB and I would recommend a bottle of Riesling and some beer.

They do take reservations if you want to call in advance.  After writing this review I've talked myself into going here tonight with my family.

I can't wait for Thai deliciousness in Doylestown of all places.",5
474,"The Best:
The waitress. I wish I had her name. Tall slender and woth long brown hair. She was charming and helpful and prompt. Best part of my meal.

The Good:
The Kei tuna was so so good. I normally don't like tuna but wow that was so good. I ordered quite a few! The inside is super beautiful and the colors are vibrant. And it had flavors that played well together. 

The Bad:
Bland was a reoccurring theme. Some of the rolls were ok but most where just absolutely flavorless (mango tango or whatever was just foam. Mango had no flavor) And I mean lemon n spice are flavors but you can't run a restraunt on 2 flavors. 

Overall I want to give them another chance and I hope I will get some more flavor if not I'll take a bunch of kei tunas.",3
475,"Paid $14 for a 10 inch Margerita pizza that was cut into 6 pieces, 2 of which didn't have any cheese on them. None.  The sauce was good, but the pizza is absurdly overpriced. The size of the pizza would be the equivalent of 2 slices at a normal pizzaria. So it's like paying $14 for 2 slices of pizza.

Also got the $10 Caesar salad. Same issue. The only difference was that the salad was pedestrian, at best, and the pizza was actually pretty good.",2
476,"Are they closed?? Every time we stop, their sign says open but they are closed. Bummer",1
477,"Excellent meal! We shared a very nice size portion Mediterranean Salad which they split into two plates. My better half enjoyed the white shrimp scampi and I ordered the Black Bass With risotto and fresh veggies. The fish was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. Their homemade desserts were extremely appealing. We decided on the coconut cream cake and lemon sorbet- both excellent!!",4
478,"We ventured to Newtown to visit a local winery on our first wedding Anniversary. Found this amazing restaurant on Yelp and it felt like we were back in Italy where we had gone for our honeymoon.
The food was authentic and our server, Crescienzo, was amazing!
Even though we live over an hour away, we are definitely coming back!",5
479,"Every Time I am in town in do stop buy here.  Very simple and fast food.  Breakfast burritos are good and BIG!   Usually split!  Sometimes they just make it to fast and have had issues nothing that was not okay to eat though.   Just made fast and no appreciation for what I was looking forward too.  Lunch Carne Asada is my fav.   

I do enjoy this place and make a point to stop by as there is not much else to choose from in the area for quick food.",3
480,"Never buy appliances from Best Buy. We had what began as a pleasant experience with the sales staff at the store, only to have our appliance deliveries delayed multiple times. 
Our fridge took a week to arrive, and was 2 days later than expected because ""well it is in the warehouse but it didn't make it to the loading dock on time.""  It then had a manufacturer defect which they said they would send a replacement part for. On the scheduled delivery day they said ""oh we never ordered the replacement part, we don't know if it can be ordered.""  They refused to take our water line back (which they didn't need and were supposed to take back) and said we had to take it ourselves in store.  Now our dryer doesn't come until September 22nd and I doubt it will arrive on time. 
Nice sales staff, terrible delivery execution.  My parents fridge broke and they bought one from Home Depot.  They had it the next day. Do not buy appliances from Best Buy.",2
481,"Biscuits is what you make it, and you can't expect to have a typical brunch at a place like this. Yes, at least 4 different waiters will be serving you, yes, it will be crowded, yes, it will be loud, yes everything in the place is mismatched and thrown together but that is all part of the beauty of Biscuits. The food isn't going to blow your mind but I guarantee you will not leave hungry. It's large portions of everything. The biscuits and gravy are good and I really like the breakfast tacos. I have never had a bad experience here. Biscuits provides it's customers with large portion breakfast or Mexican dishes with no fuss or frills. Let's just say you won't want to Instagram a pic of your plate you will just want to eat your food and have a lazy day.",4
482,"This was our first visit to this center. It was so nice! Super clean, very friendly staff. We were in and out of there in under 45 minutes. We were there to have my son evaluated my enlarged tonsils/adenoids, not actual surgery. I'd totally return!",5
483,"Brutally awful on all accounts. Fish is extra not fresh and mealy as well. The rice is generally served cold as ice which is pretty offensive. Never go here. Also, never order from here. Also, don't eat anything from here. Unacceptable.",1
484,"I went for dinner last night with family. We were seated promptly but it took over 5 minutes for our waitress to say hi and take our drink order. She always seemed in a hurry to talk to us. The place seemed understaffed. I ordered the filet mignon. It was cooked perfectly (medium was actually pink). The sides were unassuming. A side of broccoli that I didn't think was seasoned in any way. And some crispy overcooked potato wedges (slightly spicy). Presentation was poor and it looked like any amateur could have done that. I give it the three stars based on the meat alone, otherwise would have been lower.",3
485,"OPA! Love love love this little gem of a BYOB in the Fairmount hood. The girls and I walked right in on a Friday night with a few bottles of wine in hand and had a wonderful experience at Zorbas. We shared an array of dishes such as the cold platter stocked with great mix of yummy greek dips ( hummus, feta , tzatzikii etc). It was a hit for sure- just note that it comes with one pita- the dips are very generous and the 5 of us had no problem sharing- we had to request more pita though (which by the way, the pita is perfect). The mussels in a sweet red red wine sauce sans shells were so tasty. The hot feta dip and spring salad were also just as good. We topped the meal off splitting a delicious slice of cake in honor of my friend's birthday. The service was very accomodating and the atmosphere inside is super cozy- nothing fancy,  has an old school Greek feel. All of this for a mere $15/person.  You can't beat it ! I can't wait to head back and try some of the fishes and meats on the menu.",4
486,Havent been to outback in years but the great outback steakhouse i knew has turned into the mcdonalds of steakhouses. The quality of service and quality of food is a complete 180 from 5 years ago. It feels like they lost their vision. Highly recommend local restaurants that care about their service and food rather than treating you like just another sheep.,1
487,"I ordered a med pizza with pepperoni & mushrooms and 2 gyro platters on grubhub. When I finally got my order, which took a little over an hour, the food was cold and my pizza didnt have any pepperoni on it. When I called the restaurant I spoke with manager who agreed to send me another pizza but was very adamant about me sending the wrong pizza back to him. I told him I didnt eat it and was willing to send it back. Another 50 mins later, I called because I hadnt received my new pizza yet. He said that the pizza was on its way and again told me he wants his pizza back and immediately hung up the phone on me. The food is usually good but their customer service sucks. Don't be mad at the customer if you messed up! I usually order from here atleast once or twice a month but I think I'm going to take my business somewhere else now.",1
488,"Nice sit-down pizza spot in the Loop area, near Washington University. We went on a Friday night, so they were fairly busy and sat outside. Service was friendly, but not as attentive as one might hope.

Pizza was very good...we had two types of pizza. Ingredients seemed fresh, and the crust was nice and chewy. It seems like a small would be enough for two....they recommended a large, but we only ate about half of it.

The inside seemed very loud...we were glad to be sitting outside.

Overall, a nice spot for pizza.",4
489,"I ventured away from my hotel in search of a casual dinner and local brew on my first night in Indy.  Unfortunately, I did not check the game schedule and wandered right into Pacers mayhem.  After finding that my original choice was pack to bursting, I found Pearl Street Pizzeria and boy am I glad I did! 

It was pretty full when I came in but it cleared out a few minutes before game time.  I was treated to lovely, personal service that I couldn't believe.  When I put a few bucks into the jukebox right before it switched off, they actually gave me my $5 back.  I don't think that's ever happened to me before. 

The local beer selection was well rounded and the staff all seemed to have a pretty decent knowledge of the varieties on tap.  I had the honey mustard chicken pizza at the suggestion of my waitress.  It was kind of life-changing, you guys.  Like, mustard on a pizza?  This could be the new ""put an egg on it.""  

Bottom line: You treated me very well in a very unfamiliar city, Pearl Street.  If I ever make it back to Indy, I'll be stopping by.  And I'll be bragging about your pizza to everyone in the meantime.",4

491,"I bought a used Honda Accord here a few years ago and am frankly confused by the other reviews here.  So here is my experience:

I had a check in hand with a pre-approved amount from my bank.  I scouted the vehicle online from my bank. I emailed the dealer and scheduled a time to come by, mainly so the car would not be sold before I got there. 

When I arrived the salesman I had corresponded with was not on site and another salesman helped. Apparently he was new and the general manager (I think) assisted him.  I had a junker to turn in (worth maybe $300) and simply stated that I wanted the car at an online price given to me by my banks auto purchase section.

After they added all their dealer fees and taxes and such the car was of course outside the price my bank had pre-approved. I was told that at this price they would fix the non-functioning driver window and provide some limited warranty service. This would have taken my whole loan and required a cash payment from me--unacceptable to me.

I basically told them: I get the car for the amount given to me by the bank and not a dollar more or I go back home in the junker. After some talking in the other room they came back with this: car is yours but we won't fix the window.  That's a completely fair deal and I paid it. I drove home in that car twenty minutes later.

This place offers some lifetime warranty stuff that a used car isn't eligible for, but they did honor another standard feature here: a few free oil changes (I don't know the exact deal).  It has been over 1.5 years and tomorrow I am getting my 3rd free oil change.  Staff is always polite. 

It's a car dealership. They aim to sell cars and service and make money, but they aren't rude about it if you refuse or beat them at their own game.  Getting angry over that is like being pissed off at a scorpion who stung you, it's what they do.",4
492,"We went at the recommendation of a friend.  We got the beef carpaccio, burger, and truffle fries.  It was a great experience ans it definitely met my high expectations for the place.  These was a wait of 40 min for a walk in but it was cool since Cycle Brewing was right across the street :).  Make sure to call in if you don't want to wait but they also have a neat waiting room that used to be a hotel lobby.",5
493,"Opening day drive thru at 6:30 PM: AMAZING!

The front desk said to go in and there will be people to come take my order. But they just popped there head in and left. I was sitting front center ,so you couldn't miss me. Probably last time I'm coming here.",1

497,"Best vehicle buying experience ever! The customer service that we received by George, Tim, and Paul was phenominal. Tim was especially great to work with.  He went over my vehicles features with me and even gave me his cell phone number and told me to call him if I had any questions. 

We will definitely be doing business with them again!!!",5
498,I order pizza and chicken cheesesteaks from here on a regular basis. Their Sicilian is awesome! Also great is that you can buy some bear when you drop by.,4
499,Went here on the spur of the moment after looking at the menu on yelp. My friends didn't want to stay so I ordered my food to go. They brought it out on plates and then took 15 minutes to put it in a box. After getting home I realized the bottom of the flatbread was burnt and inedible. The truffle Mac was ok.,2

However, southbound access is available either via U-turn at the next intersection or via the adjacent Comcast parking lot, from which there's a connecting lane.

The indoor seating area was clean and service was straightforward and efficient.",4
502,"Food was not very good and speed of service is very slow. Our waitress was very friendly tho. Granted We cane here on a Friday night, but it shouldn't take 1hr and half to serve dinner for two.  Poor execution on food and speed of service. I will not be coming here again.",2

Not only is the shop clean and esthetically pleasing but the service was done to my exact wishes. Thank you Kim, I will be returning. My only feedback, for the price, I should have been offered water or wine.",5
504,"Welcome to Meridian, Panera! Love the Pick Two with Chicken Cobb Salad and Chicken Noodle Soup. Ever since Corner Bakery dropped the Santa Fe Salad I've been looking for a substitute - thanks Panera, I found it. Excellent flavors and good portions. Still working out the kinks of a new place-they forgot to include part of my meal and the iced tea ran dry in mid day. Those things should never happen, especially when you're trying to create a new fan base. Hopefully they will work those things out. The layout of the restaurant is not ideal. Order area is cramped and tucked awkwardly past a small pastry display. Chairs and tables are cramped and scattered making it difficult to walk to a table or the drink station. Hopefully they continue the good food choices and keep the place clean and stocked properly. I'll be back!",4
505,"Went to the newest addition to Japanese food on the north side, early on a Wednesday evening. 

It's nice to have another option in the area, that isn't Sakura or H20, and who doesn't love a restaurant where their ""mascot"" is an octopus dressed as a hibachi chef?

The decor reminded me of something out of a Sims game - black, red and futuristic, a refreshing style for a city that is often full of stale interior design for restaurants. Lots of fancy LED lighting and a bit of tacky fish oriented decorations too, but, it's nice and comfortable and contemporary.  Even the music playing over the loud speaker was downtempo, providing a ""big city"" feel to the establishment.

We were greeted instantly, and seated in the dining area, being that we were here for sushi and not hibachi. All the hibachi tables were being used though, either by groups or couples.  They also have a larger hibachi in a private area for large groups.

My friend had some spicy rolls and really enjoyed them. The presentation was clean and crisp. I had some sashimi and the fish was fresh, generous and delicious. I went to Sakura two days later alone, and the nigiri tasted fishy, when the salmon I had at Tomo was fresh and sweet, as salmon should be. 

I also had the shrimp tempura appetizer which featured two very large prawns (biggest I've had in the city!) and a nice mix of veggies. They were tasty as well. 

The service was a bit slow, but, needs were met when requests were made. They also have a somewhat vast (for Japanese) wine list and they make fancy cocktails such as mai tai's. I look forward to trying their hibachi and furthering my menu experience, glad to have Tomo here!",3
506,"Lovely neighborhood gem but worth a drive if you're not local. Nice decor. Clean. Comfortable. Excellent menu and food. Binty is best server ever!

Binty left. Hmmmmm. 10-2014",2
507,"This place is wonderful! My fiance and I had the lunch ""buffet"" today.  It's not a buffet as far as the set up. You don't go get your own food. It is brought out to you. They sit you down with a good sized menu, and you get to order whatever you want, as much as you want. They prefer if you start out with an appetizer or something, because the sushi is made to order, and depending on how busy it is (every table was occupied at noon today), you'll have a bit of a wait for it. The lunch was $9.99 per person. I don't know how you can possibly beat that! I did not care for the ginger dressing on my salad. It tasted quite bitter to me. I also didn't really care for my tempura banana. It was more of a texture thing for me. Once a banana gets heated up, it gets very mushy. Everything else was delicious. Items we ordered include shrimp shumai, gyoza, clear soup, house salad, edamame, tempura banana, Fuji roll, Hawaii roll, California roll, Alaskan roll, Philadelphia roll, and Green Sarabay roll.",4
508,"Almost $30 for two people grabbing lunch??  I think not.  Next time I'm grabbing a $5 footlong from the Subway right down Chippewa.  Add to it that Bellacino's advertises wifi but, when asked, the manager said ""It hasn't been working for a while, but if you sit close to that wall of the restaurant you can pick up Noodles from next door"".  You do realize that's stealing from another company, right?
Food is better than average, but not worth the cost...or the hassle.",2
509,"It was a gorgeous day so my friend and I decided to meet at Local Taco for lunch since they have such a great patio.  The patio is the best thing about this place in my opinion.  

First of all, it bugs me that I have to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  I realize that is common at a taco shop but it still bugs me.  Secondly, I asked our server for hot sauce when she delivered our food but, even though they were not very busy, I ended up having to go inside and get it myself because she forgot.  

Other than that the food was ok, not great, but ok.  I had a fish taco, chicken taco and street corn.  The tacos were good but the corn was cold.  

I'll probably go back for the patio but it's not my first choice.",3
510,"This is a funky little place to eat. I've only had breakfast here, and it was typical greasy diner food. They are known for their milkshakes, but since I've never tried them I can't tell you how good or bad they are. Some might call the decor of this place charming, but I honestly don't know what to think of it. You'll just have to decide for yourself.",3
511,"Service is awful. I've been here several times and no matter how slow or how busy the restaurant is, it takes at least 2 hours to eat here. The waitstaff is generally friendly and the food is decent. Just don't get bottle caps. You get a ton of mushy okra and almost no pickles.",2
512,"Was invited by friends while visiting the area and was pleasantly surprised!  The food was good and while loud and crowded, we still had a great time!

One calzone came out first because the other had a production issue, but the delay wasn't long. Ok, here's the best part of the visit: since we were there right up to the last minute, the crew was beginning pre-close duties and were hustling to get it done. The manager, Tony, very professionally and tactfully told he crew to use care so as not to disturb the dining guests. He was so low key about it, but I heard him and it demonstrated that guest experience matters, even at 10:30 on Saturday night. Thanks, SoS!",5
514,"Nice but expensive! I live in the Chicago area so I know that goceris can be costly but this place was more than I normally pay. I had to stop in while visiting family to get some salad fixings since I that was my potluck dish to bring.

Everything cost more than at home - lettuce, tomatoes, vinegar and herbs!

The store is big and has lots of food to go options with sushi and a salad bar but the layout seems a bit awkward as I kept having grocery cart traffic jams I need many areas.

It's nice but not worth the price!",3
515,"I had a very similar experience as Ada M - I took my car there for a routine inspection and they wanted over 1200 worth of work to pass it! Most of that cost was them wanting to replace both of the rear brake hardware, which was total BS. Never go here.",1

517,"I think if I was hosting a show on the Travel Channel, it would be called ""Man vs. Food Bill.""  After all, I really don't care about how much a meal costs as long as the experience is worth it.  After hitting SLeeK recently for their anniversary party (where a slider version of the Rossini was served), I knew that a visit to the Burger Bar with the beautiful wife was going to happen soon.

Unfortunately, scalability doesn't apply to burgers.  In a case where ""more should be more"" instead, all those intense flavors we had at SLeeK sort of melted together into a really good, but not anything amazing burger.  The explosiveness of the fois gras was missing, the slices of black truffle almost flavorless.

I will say that the zucchini fries were good, but again, those that we had at SLeeK were much better (I'd rather have four excellent fries than fifteen ""good"")

Service started off a bit iffy -- we were waiting at the hostess stand while she was on the phone (I swear, at first I thought it was a personal phone call) and we didn't even get a mouthed ""one minute"" or anything.  Finally, a server came over and seated us.  Kudos to him for that.

The rest of the service was fine -- prompt and friendly.

But even with that, they're not going to get a 3rd star.  When two people manage to have a bill the size we had, we better be walking away raving.  Instead, I couldn't help but think we should have gone back to SLeek.

(and for the record, the wife's burger was far tastier and $40 less than mine)",2

Service is not very good at all, in fact it is the main reason for the 3 stars.

For dine-in the servers really have no experience in serving.. you may get one meal before your friends do. I ordered a slice and some garlic knots while the rest of my party ordered 2 sandwiches. The waitress brought my slice and garlic knots together, then brought the other orders about 10 minutes later... She also asked if we wanted refills on our EMPTY glasses when she brought the slice, we didn't get our drinks until we were done eating our food. The place had a total of 5 patrons ( 3 at our table ). At the time they had 2 waitresses working, 1 lady working the cash register and 3 or 4 cooks.

My other complaint is when ordering over the phone for pickup. I have ordered at all times, late/early, lunch/dinner and have given them plenty of time to finish the order 20-30 mins before I show up and still end up waiting 20 minutes for my order. I have even tried paying by CC with hopes they would make the order before I showed up... Someone needs to teach them some urgency and they would get 4-5 stars.

Food is pretty good, pizza always consistent. Stromboli's are HUGE and tasty. Garlic knots are pretty good, cheese steaks are pretty good. Wings are average.",3
524,Extremely rude customer service and uncalled for.  What happened to the friendly people here?!?,1
525,"Delicious! So glad that this gorgeous little coffee and donut shop moved in! It's beyond cute inside, and the donuts are delicious. Keep in mind, the donuts are baked and available in just a few flavors daily, but I haven't had one that disappointed me yet. Their cold-brew coffee is also wonderful, perfect for the hot, hot summer!",5
526,Such a cute place for lunch. The seasonal and ornate aesthetic is adorable and so fun and the food is phenomenal (not just the baked goods)! Only downside is it's always packed and can be pretty slow. But it's good enough that it's worth the wait.,4
527,Love this place! It's charming and the staff is very welcoming and friendly. Barb did more than an amazing job on coloring my hair. Highly recommend this place for anyone who needs a good cut and color!,5
528,"The only reason I'm giving this place a two stars instead of one is that my dining partner really enjoyed his Chicken Alfredo.  We both got half orders of pasta on the recommendation of the server, which was one of the only positive things about our service.  He took a while to get to us, didn't bring our dinner rolls until after our pasta, and our pasta orders took at least 20 minutes.  I'm pretty forgiving as long as a server says something along the lines of ""Sorry it took a minute for your food, the kitchen got slammed"" or whatever, but he didn't seem like he even noticed the delay.  My pasta was lukewarm, and the sauce had sort of separated out, making it less than appealing.  I was really excited about the Cajun pasta, but it was disappointing even ignoring the temperature.  I could taste the parsley there was so much in it, and it was a lot heavier sauce than I expected.  The dinner rolls weren't anything special, even though the server recommended not ordering garlic bread because of them.  Overall, I'd recommend somewhere else for dinner in St. Louis.",2
529,I love this place. Super friendly. The interior design is really cute and fits the Asian theme. Food is always good. This is my regular sushi joint. They also serve Thai food. I tried the pad Thai. It was alrightttt. I've had better. But I love their sushi rolls. A MUST try is the Spicy Crawfish Roll and the BlueCrab Tempura roll. I don't think it's on the menu you have to order it. They don't always have crawfish though. Make sure to ask for extra eel sauce and sriracha for more sauce if you like it that way. I sure do! They also have happy hour. BOGO drinks. And happy hour on sushi too. Definitely worth checking out. Would recommend to anyone interested in sushi and Asian food.,4
530,"This gets two stars instead of one due to the sauce is good. The chicken was over cooked, and the fries were so hard and overcooked that they were hollow on the inside. They need to change the grease as well. I don't understand why people are calling this a great place to get wings anything else in Tucson is better.",2
531,"Ok this is an aberration from my city foodie reviews but I figured I'll take the time and review some of the local establishments that I order from on a consistent base while working in Bensalem, P.A.  Without further adieu...
George's Chix is good.  I'm always satisfied with the food and value each and every time.  I haven't branched out seeking much more than a good deal each time and trust me I'm not looking to find the healthiest option on the menu (usually I get the nugget/fries/soda deal, the chix fingers/fries/soda deal, or Ceasar wrap/fries/soda deal- $8 or $9 after a nice tip) but the food is alright.
Give George's a try if you're in town and looking to get down on some fried grub!",3
532,"A great place to get ramen in Philadelphia.  I have tried a bunch of ramen places in NYC and this is on par with them.  Tried the standard miso ramen and the broth was extremely flavorful and delicious.  The base is the key to good ramen and this places knows there stuff.

We had also started off with the dumplings in chili oil, the night we went featured a beef / pumpkin / squash combo that was delicious.  The pumpkin / squash cut the richness and was a perfect compliment as a filling.

Service was very good.  Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Venue was pretty small but there are plenty of bars in the area to visit while you wait.",4
533,"#NOLAtourism #chifoodie #foodtourism We did the jazz evening cruise.  The band played two sets both great.  The table service was attentive and the drinks were responsibly priced and in some cases cheap.  However... this is definitely a one time only tourist thing to do.  The narration on the boat was informative but way too short.  And most unfortunately food at the buffet was not traditional Creole fare-- instead it was the same buffet we could have a had a convention in Milwaukee.  If you choose to do this cruise-- buy the cruise only tickets, enjoy the drinks, the view and the band.  Eat before, afterwards or both.  Three stars for the experience.  One star for food.",3
534,"This is actually an 'Advance' Auto Parts now, at this same address: 

Terrible service. Came in with a battery (Advance brand) that needed to be replaced. Store was not at all busy. Two employees were making small talk with a female customer and a third was attending to a battery replacement for another customer. I waited with my wife for about 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged I was there. I finally asked the two employees who were making small talk with the customer if one of them might be able to help me and neither of the employees even turned my way, but instead made derisive comments under their breath to the female customer, who then explained how she was a 'customer' and she was being helped (despite having no items to purchase or having any kind of conversation regarding anything automotive with staff). I suspect she was an off the clock employee since she was the only one who would even address me. I located another Advance store on my phone, gathered my battery and began to leave. One of the employees finally deigned to offer to help me, but I wouldn't have taken a battery from that store if they were giving them away for free at that point. I went to the AAP on US19 and Central, where I received decent customer service and would return again. I will never set foot in the Gulfport AAP ever again, and I don't recommend any else do so either, unless you enjoy being ignored while employees conduct personal conversations with friends/off duty employees.",1
535,"After being disappointed with the previous Thai place I used to go to I decided to try this one out.  I ordered takeout of Yellow Curry, Pad Thai, Clear Noodle Dish (Pad Woon Sen), and a appetizer sampler platter.

The sampler platter was okay, but forgettable about the only thing that both my wife and I enjoyed was the spring rolls.  The other items were either too greasy, too salty, or just too fried.

The Pad Thai was a little mild for my taste, but I still enjoyed this immensely.  Very light and tasty and I would recommend this if you do not like spicy food, but very tasty.

The clear noodles or Pad Woon Sen is one of my favorite dishes, very light and very delicate.  The noodles play well with the vegetables and was not overcooked at all, not easy to accomplish because this dish is easy to burn or cook until rubber.

The Yellow Curry was the best, my wife commented that it was the best she had.  It was the best I've had in a long time.  I will definitely be trying this again.

While I was there looking at the menu I was counting the number of times I would need to come back and try everything I wanted to order tonight, quite a few trips I need to make.  I think I have found my new Thai Place.",4
536,"I agree with the other sentiments about the food and service at the new location. Have eaten at the old and new, and this one just lacks. I'm curious to hear if they get their mojo back. I really liked them in the previous location.",3
537,"Co-workers and I have been going to the lunch buffet once every month or two for years and love it!  Now, I'm not too well versed in Indian food, so don't have much to go on.  But, I am an experienced ""eater"", if you will, and this place has great eats!  Favs are the naan, chicken tikka masala and sagg paneer (equates to spiced creamed spinach in my book).  Also love the mango yogurt drink and milk tea.  I scoffed at the idea of a buffet at first, but this one is worth your while. It's a great way to try a lot of different types of Indian food without emptying your pocketbook or ordering something that you wish you had only sampled before committing. It's very busy here at lunch during the week- the service on plate clearings, water, and keeping the buffet well stocked is great.",5
538,Very disappointed. No follow through from the individual who said she would call me back. Piss poor customer service.,1
539,"I love this place. The snoballs are delicious - so far my favorite is watermelon. The best part about it - no extra charge for sweetened condensed milk! They really don't need it but I have grown up eating my snoballs with cream and that's how I like it. 

Everyone should check this place out. Young, old - you will leave satisfied. This is a great addition to Freret St.",5
540,Pretty good and reasonably priced. Kind of small portions. Not too busy on a Friday night and easily able to accommodate a large crowd.,3
541,"As usual, this restaurant doesn't seem to heed the bad reviews and fix the problems. Dinner here last night was abysmal. The prime rib was 40% fat with tons of gristle. My dog wouldn't even eat the left overs!  Who wants cold fries? I asked for regular butter (not cinnamon) and never got it. Hey, Jeanne, do you not even TRY to fix your problems?",1
542,"They had me at the copper bunny...vodka, pineapple jalapeño tequila, lime juice and sparkling wine in a beautiful copper bunny (it packs a wallop). Don't try to find one to buy...they mold and make them just for the restaurant.
Starters included fresh chilled gulf oysters and crispy conch fritters with pineapple tarter sauce.  We then proceeded to two tuna ""small bites:"" sushi grade hamachi lightly tossed with a guava curry and papaya, and more traditional tuna tartare...they couldn't have been better.  We were a little scared to try the curried goat but it was
incredibly tender and the curry paired perfectly with the melt-in-your-mouth sweet potato gnocchi.  No room for dessert but we can't wait to come back to NOLA and Compère Lapin!",5
543,"When all your employees have ear buds, listening to Spotify, it's not a good look.  Maybe that's why my order was late.",2
544,"I went to this restaurant the other night. All I can say is that it was the absolute WORST experience I have ever had. The staff were completely incompetent and rude, I should have just got up and left at this point. Once I finally got to order it took forever to get my dinner. After I got my dinner it was lukewarm at best and I said something to the waitress who basically acted as if I were bothering her. The best part is that after all this and I finally began eating I saw what looked like a ROACH crawling out from under one of the tables adjacent to me. I ended up speaking to one of the owners, Mario, who tried to give me every excuse under the sun as to what happened and what I saw. His wife then came over and started basically yelling at me. She was the most rude and inconsiderate person I have EVER met. Stay FAR away from this place, who knows what kind of diseases are roaming around that kitchen and its staff!!!!!",1
545,"This was my 2nd time dining here. Once again received wonderful service from a great staff & amazing red cabbage. Tried a new bourbon, 4 roses I think. Love the variety of poisons to choose from!!! We'll surely be back again.",4
546,"I like everything about this place but the food.  Owner is nice and polite, menu has quite a few options but the taste of their food is something which doesn't appeal to me.
I have tried alot of their food every time I thought of giving it another chance but I sadly to have say that I did not find anything tasty.",2
547,"Let me just start by saying I've been to a lot of mechanics and auto repair centers and this is by far the best one I've ever been to and the one I will always continue to go to no matter how far out of the area I am. 

The owner is very honest and very helpful and will do anything it takes to get you up and running again and is very knowledgeable and smart. I came here a couple times already and have always gotten honest answers and great results.

I know most mechanics seem like they're just for the morning but I can put my word on it but this place is in it for your happiness and safety also. So if you're in the area even if it's just for an oil change stop by and see for yourself.

The owner Pete Will give you all your options and if he doesn't have the parts on hand he will get them here very quickly. 

I have a Nissan Pathfinder that was just about ready for the junkyard. After he looked at it and found a couple things that were not expensive at all to fix I've already gotten another 36,000 miles and still drive it. He saved me countless money on more then one occasion.

I've had simple repair work done as far as maintenance and oil changes I've also had an a whole exhaust replaced here before.",5
548,Great experience! We will def return. We stayed in the deluxe king room. The decor was beautiful and the fireplace very romantic for Valentine's day. Kirsten at the front was very helpful in recommending a seafood restaurant. Can't wait to go back!,5
549,"The food is good, beer is good. The waitress is friendly ... the place isn't very lively. It looks sad  maybe better music  or drink specials or food specials. It's not over priced, the just place needs SOMETHING. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sliders, they are tasty. The beer is local, it's pretty good (if you like beer).",3
550,"Okay, we were off to a bad start.  Party of 9 (4 adults & 5 kids ages 8-12).  It wasn't packed ( but we were packed in a kind of wrap around booth).  

We were there an hour before our food was served.  The waitress kept up with drink refills and apologies.  5-stars for her!

When the food finally arrived it was hot and impressive in both taste and presentation.  The burgers were mile-high with toppings, and the kids meals satisfied our big kids. I would say worth the wait but that wait was way too long with no visit from the management.   

I'll come back for the Cowboy Burger and hope for the best.",3
551,"Great local pizza joint. Affordable price, quick turn around for pick up. Delivery time is pretty average. Everyone I have dealt with is courteous. We've been eating here for decades.",5
552,"This was our first time to order takeout at this place and most likely it will be the last. There were two people cooking and one of them was also taking orders. It has been over 45 minutes and counting since we walking into this place and no food. While waiting we over heard multiple people (at least 8 people) calling regarding the status of their delivery...which had been ordered a long time ago...Note to self...never order delivery from this place!  

I hope the food is better than the service! Well after 1 hour and 10 minute my order was ready but it was not what I ordered. DO NOT GO TO This place if you are in a hurry in expect your order should be what you ordered. I asked for a refund and the owner started yelling in Chinese or Cantonese it took me 5 minutes to tell them and make them understand that I want a refund after waiting over an hour in 10 minutes for my order",1
553,"The food is ok~ 
It's honestly just a mediocre diner like everywhere else. I do enjoy the cheese sticks though. 
My server on the other hand was very sweet, polite and on top of her game. 
My order had originally came out cold and she was so sweet and patient about fixing it. I give it a 3 because of the food...",3
554,"I made an appointment for a tune up. Today I was scheduled for service from 12-4 pm. 3:40pm I called and asked if I was still scheduled. The gentleman who answered was nice and sent me to the dispatch person. She said ""I called you earlier today to let you know we were running late due to a broken truck"" Well they never called. I wont use them again and I'm glad they never came out as I dont like to be lied to. Remember most people never compliment so Im sure they have many happy customers. Im not one of them, my time was wasted.",2
555,"I've left a previous post about cat before, who has since left EWC. My new wax lady is also great. But this review is on their receptionists.

I find them cold, rude, unwelcoming, and generally uninterested in anything I'm saying. Some of them are great, but it seems whenever I call into the store I'm greeted by the same girl who always makes it sound like I'm annoying her by asking a question. She actually has no warmth or friendliness at all when talking to you, and it actually pisses me of and makes me want to frequent a different wax salon. This is a service industry, so when you expect a certain kind of service and you're met with abrupt and rude service, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Once my package is over, I'm not sure I'll be buying another.",2
556,Visiting from out of town I was excited to visit Chef Milly's newly opened restaurant.  It was a sore DISAPPOINTMENT. Waited even w/a reservation and tried to be patient since they had just recently opened.  Chef Milly does not even offer a smile to his visitors.  The food was just OK and definitely not worth the wait.  I will commend my server (I think his name was Ty) on his professionalism even amongst the multiple jobs he was tasked.  Chef Ramsey would be highly disappointed - I surely was.,1
557,Best Nebeyaki Udon I've had since my dear (Japanese trained sushi chef) friend died 5 years ago. I'm almost reluctant to share this since it's not something people order all that often. I want to keep this best kept secret all to myself.,5
558,"Just o.k. food. Acceptable service. Not-so-great interor design/ambience. 

They got lucky with their location. They have a long way to go to prove they're worthy!",2
559,"When a friend suggested we try Han Dynasty, I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard it was a ""nicer"" Chinese food restaurant, almost like P.F. Changs, but I didnt quite get it until I walked in. I was a little disappointed with the service at first because the hostess did not acknowledge of bother to greet us for a good 5 minutes. The decor of the place was trendy and unique with lots of red. Definitely a step up from P.F. Changs if you ask me, and better lit. I let my friend order for us because he'd dined there before, and we ended up getting the dan dan noodles with pork and the chicken dry pot. We asked for extra spicy sauce on the noodles and the waiter was more than happy to oblige - they definitely had a kick, but nothing we couldn't manage. Overall a solid meal with plenty of food for a very reasonable price!",3
560,"Good service but TERRIBLE FOOD. Overcooked everything, one of the worst dining experiences ever.",1
561,"This restaurant is small, quaint and has a calm indoor outdoor dining experience. Great for lunch, and we order delivery at least once a week. They have NEVER disappointed us. :). 

Hey have an extensive menu. The staff are genuine and down to earth. This place is great for those who are looking for no frills. Easy going, quick bites. 

This restaurant works like a well oiled machine. 
Autonomous and natural felling to the place.",5
562,"Decided to give Dimaggio's a shot tonight for dinner. Been driving by since they opened.
Not too shabby.
As they label themselves a steak and pizza place, I settled on the House Steak calzone. A nice mix of both. Indulged in a poutine on the side.
For ~$20...I was pleasantly surprised.
Nice decor.
Friendly server. Never did get a refill on my Iced tea...
Good food. Large, filling serving size.
Not going to rush back...but not going to rule out a return visit either.",3
563,"What a great restaurant... quiet, quaint, and soft piano and jazz music playing in the background. The only reason I can not give it 5 stars is because they currently do not have an alcohol license. As for the food however, unbelievable! Fresh, great portions, and wonderful service.

If you want to a great meal and some quiet time to melt off the stress, please eat here. The outside makes you think twice, but that's always the best when it is that Good!

P.S. they give you real china and authentic chop sticks that are hand painted... how cool is that?",4
564,"This was my second time here, both times during weekday lunchtime with my coworker. The first time was ok, food was decent and we were the only table in the place yet were waiting around for our checks. Our most recent visit we were surprised to see that there were new notes on the menu stating ""no split checks"". We asked the waitress if there was a way to just to put half bill on one card and half on another card since could not split checks and would not give us separate checks. She said no. I asked if there was an ATM on site to get money out and she said no. Finally she said she would just have to put our orders on different tables so that we can have separate checks. There was also a note put on the menu about extra chips being extra which I found odd as I have never seen that at a Mexican restaurant before. I could understand the split checks rule on a busy night with large parties but the fact they were giving us a hard time when we were once again the only people in the restaurant. Many people in this area go to lunch together with coworkers. On the plus side, the food was good this time and server was otherwise friendly.",2
565,Great service! Conch fritters were delicious! Will visit when in town again! Beautiful view of the bay.,5
566,Staff is unorganized.  Rooms are mediocre.  Prices in the hotel in general are marked up and the elevators sound like the are on their last leg.  Many other options in the area to enjoy.,2
567,"Food was actually quite good, and the place has definite New Orleans style and character that I like.  The service was quite poor, though.  I usually read reviews complaining about service with a huge grain of salt and tend to ignore them as coming from whiners who find fault everywhere.  But when I took my family to Jack Dempsey's this weekend, it was the worst service I have had in years.  Inattention, getting the order wrong, very long delays while the waitress was clowning around with old friends at another table (which was not even her table).  I won't be going back, which is a shame because I liked the place and the fried seafood was well above average.",2
568,"This is the worst service I have had at a restaurant in Philadelphia. First, they charged myself and the rest of my group a $5 cover, but then proceeded to seat us outside. The server forgot about us and we eventually were able to put our drink orders in. When they came,  we had lower than average margaritas and sangrias. I wouldn't come back here again.",1
569,"We spent six wonderful days at Hotel Mazarin, and I have to say that this has been the perfect hotel experience. Great room, wonderful breakfast, and every person on staff has been a joy to deal with. Very close to - but luckily not ON - Bourbon Street, and close to everything in the Quarter. Recommended without hesitation!",5
570,"Good food and for a chain very good food. It lived up to its reputation of serving fresh food. I give it three stars instead of four mainly because it's probably not on my top 10 places in Reno for Mexican food. Chipotle is not even my favorite Mexican-themed chain restaurant. That would be El Pollo Loco.
For my meal I got a burrito with beef, black beans, white rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and maybe some other stuff. I added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce.
I had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times I came. The staff was friendly when I placed my order. I got my burrito, chips and salsa when I paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later.
Chipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food. The chips are good quality chips. The salsa tastes mass produced. It was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times. My favorite salsas are the red salsa from the Michoacan region of Mexico with its nice garlic kick. 
The ingredients in the burrito were fresh, but there were two significant flaws. No. 1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else. Usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans, but not in this case. It made the burrito bland and a little dry. The second flaw was all the gristle I found on the beef. My tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time I finished. I decided to spare Yelpers a photo of that.
The margarita was okay. I'd get one again but it was routine.
There's basically two kinds of wine bars: Those that serve wine that wine geeks like (these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving) and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink. I get the sense that Chipotle is a Mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there.  Again, for a chain, they serve good quality food. I can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town. 
Chipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking. For people who have never had a good chipotle in a Mexican restaurant, I would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla (devil shrimp) at La Fuente in Sparks. It's quite a bit spicier than the hot salsa served at Chipotle but it has great depth of flavor.",3
571,Had a great stay at this hotel right in the french quarter. convenient walking to everything on bourbon street and beyond. their continental breakfast had a large variety of items and was free per your stay. great comfy beds. A huge plus was the non-smoking hotel that doesn't allow smoking throughout. Attentive service and wonderful experience. Great ambiance and decor as i loved the courtyard fountain area at night to just relax after a day in NOLA. Bathrooms were a bit small and the shower could of used a door as water splashed out to the main area but overall it was a comfy room. Free wifi and the staff service was impeccable. We had a fuse blown and the repair was done in 15 min. after we called it in. Another plus is the free bottled water everyday as they gave us 2 bottles on the dresser along with 2 in the fridge. Highly recommended for a stay in the French quarter.,4
572,"Blue Sage has been my go to place during the Lenten season for the past few years! As someone who eats meat, I had doubts about trying it initially since it's a 100% vegetarian but I was pleasantly surprised and now I'm hooked! 

I love the feel of this place -- it's very charming. It's pretty small so I recommend that you make a reservation especially if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday evening. Please also note that it's BYOB and the dessert menu changes occasionally. 

The adobo goat cheese nachos are a must try! I also recommend the black bean soup, the mediterranean sampler, the blue corn asparagus tacos, and the falafel wrap. 

The only dish which I'm not fond of is the wild mushroom risotto.",5
573,"alright i love qdoba but this location is an exception. i just moved to the area and before would frequent the hermitage and west end stores which are delicious. 

the first time i came to the brentwood location they were completely out of ground beef. it was later in the evening (around 8) so i figured the day had just took its toll and it was fine. i ordered chicken instead to go. 

the chicken was tough, dry and impossible to bite through so i ended up throwing my meal away, but again i chalked this up to just a bad experience. 

so tonight i came back. ordered the tacos again. this time they had the beef which i was pleased about. i began paying while the girl finished up my tacos, which were completely wrong. swimming in sour cream which i didn't ask for and no tortilla strips or corn. again no big deal. i walk up to the counter and mention my order was wrong. i even told the girl she could just scrape the sour cream off and i would still enjoy them but her manager insisted on a remake. 

the cashier snatches my plate out of my hand and begins heavily sighing, eye rolling and in general bad attitude. she remakes my tacos and hands them back to me, still sans tortilla strips and corn. i ask for them and she says, ""they're already on there,"" with the most attitude possible as if i didn't watch her remake them and no they weren't. she begrudgingly adds more, and i'm so annoyed i just take my food and leave. 

the beef was cold and i paid for queso i never got. i ordered 4 tacos and they only remade 3 of them. honestly i would rather drive 20 minutes out of my way to not have another garbage experience here.",1
574,"Have been visiting Frescos for at least 5 years and have never had bad food. Used to live a couple miles away and yes delivery was slow needed to plan ahead. Most of the time we just picked it up. They have the best pepperoni and mushroom Pizza I've had in town, love the fresh mushrooms and the manicotti is wonderful. It's no longer on the menu but they still will make it up for you just ask. I ordered salad (chef) for the first time and it was excellent, very fresh! The only negative is they need one on the east side. You can't even compare to other franchise Pizza places they don't even come close to the freshness and taste.",5
575,"I would give this place half a star if it was possible. I went for the first time recently with my boyfriend and our dog. I walked into the restaurant to first ask if my dog would be allowed on the outside patio, they told me no since she is not a service dog. That was ok with me I understood so we walked across the street to figure out where we should try next. While across the street we saw a large family and their small dog be allowed onto the very same patio we were turned away from. I walked back over and asked a different gentleman why we were turned away and this dog was allowed? He told me they said it was a service dog. ""Service dog?""  that dog was not a service dog, not in its wildest dreams. I asked the man to level with me since we both knew they had lied.
This poor excuse for a dog, not a service dog just poor excuse for a dog in general is making real service dogs be turned away because they choose to lie (SHAME ON YOU FAMILY.)
So long story short I was allowed to bring my dog to the patio after a lengthy Q & A and me promising my dog would not bark, fight, or be a nuisance. After sitting down the other ""dog"" cried and barked constantly while my dog was still and quite. The children at the same table were screaming and crying and making it not worth staying. We paid for our two cups of coffee we ordered and left. The coffee was the worst I have ever had...tasted burnt and it was $7 for it! 

Never EVER will I go there and I will never recommend it to another person and especially not to my food blogging parents. I cant wait to tell them about this place :/",1
576,"My husband and I are not ""spring chickens"", but we love to Par-Tee. The server immediately welcomed us and asked about our drink preferences.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful. The beer selection was wonderful, the liquor selection divine.  The bar food, even though it was a small selection, was excellent. I had never wanted to try pork bellies (the name turned me off.) Dan ordered it, I tried it,and we now have a convert.  WE highly recommend their pork belly sliders! I hope they continue to add a few more delicious tapas.  These folks have it together and are very engaging.  We'll be back often.",5
577,"I have dealt with a lot of screwups from this location, but they lost a long time customer tonight. Ordered online, was told to expect delivery around 10:30pm. Used a credit card so I waited on the call from the store to pay. At 10:20pm finally called them to check in. They apparently never got my order because they failed to refill the paper in their fax machine. Was told my food would be here in 25 minutes and got an apology. Food got here just after 11:00pm. They forgot the 2-liter of soda. Called the store and they said they couldn't refund my card but could leave a credit on my account for next time or the driver could bring it back. Opted for the driver to bring it back. Shortly after hanging up, open our food to fries without any cheese, as we had ordered them. Normally I let these little things slide, but 3 in one night is too much. I called again and told them thwir mistake and that we would never order again. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this place. The crappy food isn't worth the trouble.",1
578,"We made a reservation for 7:30. We arrived and were quickly seated. We were given menus and I selected a filet mignon while my husband selected a porterhouse steak. We also ordered sautéed mushrooms. We asked for the fried ravioli appetizer and it arrived in good time.  I took one bite and did not like it. I was expecting cheese filling and it was a meat filling. In fact it tasted like a meatball. My husband said they were very good. However I did not like the taste and did not eat any more of them.
My husband ordered ceasar salad and shared it with me.  It was delicious. We both felt it was the best ceasar salad we had ever had.
Next came our meals.  I had asked for rare with the butter sauce on the side. Instead it was poured over it.  It was very heavy on the garlic side.  Our waitress asked how I liked it and I told her.  She took it back to the kitchen. The owner or maybe his wife came by and apologized and asked if there was something else she could get me while I waited.  I said no because I had a beautiful baked potato in front of me.  I had maybe taken 2 bites of potato and my new steak arrived.  It was perfect.  My husband said his steak was very good. He also had the baked potato. We both ordered the potato with butter and sour cream as well as the bacon with cheese toppings.  All of this was very good.  The service was wonderful.  We ordered desert to go - tiramiso and whiskey cake. They look yummy. I could only find one very tiny flaw and that is some of the foods were a little too salty. One interesting item is the light in the middle of the room.  It is a Dale Chuhuly  piece according to management. Very beautiful.  There is also an extensive wine cellar, which we did not take advantage of. It was a nice touch to this restaurant. Overall, a very nice dinner.",4
579,"No complaints as far as Taco Bells go. Terrible for you and terribly delicious. This place is my fast food kryptonite. 

The service here is quick & friendly and they've never screwed up my order, which is more than I can say for other Taco Bell locations.",3
580,"Hands down the best Indian food in STL. Tried Indian restaurants all over the city, none of them even comes close to the authenticity of the taste that i experienced here.

Each and every item on the buffet was outstanding, which makes it even more extraordinary considering buffet items general are bland and tasteless.

Keep up the outstanding establishment, hope to come here more often",5
581,Such great food and bartender Joe is awesome!!!   Must is their She Crab Bisque. Makes you glow,5
582,"Took a road trip to Reno was looking forward to having a great Buffet dinner and friends have to me that I needed to go to the El Dorado Buffet. 

After a long drive and saving my appetite for the buffet.  I was disappointed to learn that they were not serving any seafood, crab legs in particular and the ceviche that my friends raved about.

Some of their food was over cooked or not even season enough.  Their desert bar was okay but nothing that I would write home about.

This is my opinion and everyone has their own taste buds but as a foodie that I am... it was not good.

How much do venues care about these reviews?

Regrets.",2
583,by far the WORST effort at chain mexican food. I thought this was a sister restaurant of the The Lime ( now called the Green Lemon)  and gave it a shot.  Terrible food. My wife gave me a bit of her guacamole and it tasted like water mush. one their smoky salsas tasted metallic.   DO NOT GO!!!,1
584,"I purchased a chair and matching table over a year ago and I've yet to receive the table.  I've been told it's on a boat from China (yes, that is exactly) what I was told.  Don't pay for anything until you have it in your hands.",1
585,"Nice atmosphere & decor, friendly staff but disappointed in the food. We were there on a Thursday night, not particularly busy. We ordered the wings and French onion soup. The wings had an odd taste that I did not enjoy and could not identify. The soup was fine. As entrees, I ordered the braised short ribs, which was not hot when served to me. My husband ordered a hamburger which he found unexceptional, and my daughter ordered the chicken pot pie which was enormous, but mostly filled with creamy sauce and not much discernible meat/vegetables. A bit pricey.",2
586,"This use to be a reliable place for sandwiches but the last two were not good at all.  Cheesesteak was light on the meat.  There are so many good rolls to pick from in the Philly area but this roll was one of the worst and stale.

Hopefully it was just an off night. I'll try again but not for awhile.",2

588,"I was able to walk in and get a seat at the oyster bar with no wait. This was after walking by the ridiculous line outside acme (I don't understand why that place is always so packed when there are dozens of good places near by). The oysters were great, and the horseradish really cleared my sinuses out. The crab mac and cheese was okay, but not super flavorful- adding some Crystals hot sauce took care of that though.",4
589,"Apparently they have a ""no standing rule."" We organized a party of 10 and 2 extra people showed up. The owner had a problem with this... We squished into seats but the owner wasn't having it. We offered to pay our tab and leave and she agreed. Guess she doesn't need our money? She was very rude and we won't be back.",1
590,Awful awful awful. The chef got in a fight with a patron and we waited 45 min and still didn't get food. The chef literally threw a tomato at a patron that he was in an argument with over his bulls hat. The bathroom had urine on the floor. This place isn't even sanitary and should be closed! Wish I could give it 0 stars,1
591,"Let me say, that I don't live in Missouri and my state banned indoor smoking a long time ago.

I went to Hot Shots with friends, the menu had a variety of options.  Mostly it was basic sports bar food.  I forgot Missouri allows indoor smoking, the place smelled like an ash tray and you left smelling like one too.

Service was ok, you could almost predict when the waitress would return (about every 5 minutes).  Plenty of TV screens to watch sports, over all not stellar nor good.",2
592,"Maybe 4.5 stars but my sandwich was fantastic. My thunderbird was basically a perfect mix of turkey and various porky bits on some fantastic bread. I'm also a big fan of provel and wish it was on more stuff. Wash it all down with a 90 shilling and you've got a great meal. It's a fine portion but it was so good I almost got another sandwich, which since I'm in a road trip and have no fridge, would have been a mistake.",5
593,I've been a fan for years . However the last two visits within the last two months were disappointing. The wings were extremely small . The portions are equivalent to most kids meals . The wings are tasty that's not enough to keep my loyalty .Unfortunately I will not be placing future orders .,3
594,"I went to Gypsy with a large group for a brunch. It's a small place with some outdoor seating in summer (scarce in Conshy). It wasn't my first visit, but it was my first time there for brunch. The have an all you can drink mimosa and bloody mary deal that you can add to your entree, so that's what brought us in. Unfortunately the mimosas were kind of flat. I had the waffles which kind of disappointed also. They were kind of dry, but the accompaniments were good. 

The service was good even as it became busy later in the meal. I'd actually give the meal a two star, but every place has a bad day and my other meal here have been better",3
595,"This Walmart is the bane of my existence.  The ONLY reason I EVER go in there, is because they carry some cake stuff, and since I live around the corner, if I'm in a bind, it's much more convenient then going up to Michaels on Baltimore Pk.  Notice how I did not use the term ""run-in and run-out because that will NEVER happen at this place.  

I avoid this store at all costs.  I have NEVER had a better-than-miserable experience here.  The K-Mart that is 3 minutes further from my house is awesome and I will absolutely go there for anything of the ""mart"" nature that I need.  I suggest you do the same.  

This place is a nightmare.",1
596,"I decided to try to go to CareStat Urgent Care instead of the Emergency Room for an ear infection.  I should have left after speaking with the unprofessional receptionists at the front desk.  The rest of my experience here consisted of the doctor tapping on my ear stating ""I bet this hurts."" and him asking me if the nurse I saw at another facility was a young female because she sounded like she didn't know what she was doing.  As if this wasn't bad enough for me to sit through, the 'professional'  then proceeds to mock if I have a drug problem when I declined pain killers for the ear infection.

All around a unpleasant experience.",1
597,"Here for convention and Imo's was suggested as ""The Best"" St. Louis Style pizza by hotel staff. 

I opted for delivery which was good and efficient. The food arrived still hot. I ordered a medium pepperoni and an order of toasted ravioli. 

Now, I knew the cheese on the pizza was provel so it would taste different. I was really not impressed. It may just be a matter of taste preference. It was hard to separate each piece of pizza too.  Like, it wasn't cut all the way through. Not really a fan. So thumbs down on the pizza. 

What bumps the stars up are the T-Ravs!  I was hoping for cheese ravioli but the staple is a meat mixture. Boy...do they do it justice. They were the bomb!  The sauce with it was too watery but still tasty. I would order just the ravioli next time!",3
598,"This was nothing special and seemed a little overpriced for quantity. 

It's a typical diner/cafe.  All American (and the decor will not let you forget that).

The food was not memorable and I think there are better breakfast places on the east side.  But if you are in the area and don't want to look elsewhere, swing on here.",2
599,"My first experience did mot go well due to the heavy accents of the employees. I called ahead so my order would be ready for me to pick up and it was, it just was not what I ordered. They are nice people and corrected my order but instead of simply picking up my food I had to wait 20 minutes To get my original order. When all was said and done, the food was good.

I was nearby and decided to give them a second chance. This time I ordered a pizza steak and I was really impressed! I need to have a couple more before I can declare them my new favorite pizza steak. Plenty of mozzarella cheese and the roll is stuffed with meat and just enough sauce. It's looking like this place is a lot better than my first impression.",4
600,"I have been here several times.  Never memorable...always enjoyable.  Their garlic bread is outstanding and I like their sauces but the entrees are not consistent.  Tonight I challenged my server that my chicken had been microwaved.  She denied and disappeared.  She said they don't have a microwave...maybe yes, maybe no.  It was just extremely hot in the center and tough.  At any rate we did not see her again and John took over.  On a plus, the host...John...is one of the best I've run into in Bucks.  Please will a top quality restaurant hire him.  He's worth another 20% in biz.  This isn't the one!",3
601,"New to the area, I found this convenient location...hair cut was good but services fell way way short. Maybe my expectations are a NY thing...Escorted to chair...had to ask if I could get a shsmpoo...wasn't  asked if I wanted one. Seems like there missing the boat here, on a good revenue source. At the end, my side burns were not squared off with electric trimmers, nor was the back of my upper neck, or ears cleaned up of those hairs that are also to long. I'm old guy with good eyebrows and in NY they ask if I would like them trimmed (and I do...lol). They didn't even brush off my neck off of the loss cuttings with a brush. So I had to spend an itchy afternoon...UGH. These little things take but a moment make a hugh difference and are a reflection on there lack of attention, pride in workmaship and caring. The whole time I was across from the Mgr desk and watched her playing on here computer...WOW...Here's a novel idea...have your system note new customers  and greet and welcome them. Maybe to much to ask the Mgr to work so hard. I'll try Super Cuts next...hope it's better...",1

Rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable.  In order to take the elevators to guest floors you needed to have a room key, this was an unexpected plus. The location was convenient.  When booking our trip we wanted to be close to Bourbon Street, but fortunately we ended up on Royal Street which turned out to be much nicer, cleaner, and had wonderful shopping and restaurants.",5
603,"I signed up for their Chef's Table e-mails and I received a $30 gift certificate for my birthday- good towards the entire check, not just my individual meal! We had two sushi rolls, seaweed salad and fillet Mignon, hibachi style. Everything was GREAT! The service was great and the atmosphere was just dimly lit enough, without being dark at all. They had an interesting drink menu that I will have to try next time! Also, their happy hour is from 5-8 and includes MANY half-priced items and drinks... we are definitely going back soon!",4
604,"I took a cooking class at La Cucina and it was sub-par at best. I learned nothing, since everything that was taught was so elementary, that I already knew the techniques.

A super chill spot for literally any meal or any occasion. If you're in the neighborhood, gotta check it out!",5

Some time during the last three months it felt like they started cutting back on the portions. Nonetheless, always clean, food is delicious, staff is nice enough.",3
609,"Whoa!  Sunday nights sports nights. Wow!  My wife and I wanted a later dinner and we stopped in Dooney's. We have been here many times before and I get the Reuben and she loves the healthy salmon salad. But stop the press - they have a special menu on a sheet of paper that was just outstanding!  First of all I was blown away by $2 drafts and $3 23 ounce beers. What a savings. And you can get nachos for $4, nachos supreme for $6 and they have Irish nachos for $4. Try them!  Then what got us was the $5 cheesesteaks!  So forget healthy tonight-we pigged out and took home the other half of the cheesesteaks. I had 2 big beers (she was driving) and our tab came to $26. Not to mention I could watch my Packers win on our personal table side TV!!!  I love this place!",4
610,"Paid $20 for a fill. I've gone before for a full set by Minh and that lasted like two and a half weeks. This one an older woman did them and they are all very nice but nice doesn't equal quality. While they did stay extra long to do my nails because I got there twenty to close, they let me go without my nails even being fully painted and thus they were smudged badly. On top of that within three days I had two broken nails. Very disappointed. As a college student who works hard and I have rare little luxuries such as getting my nails done, and when I do spend my time and money to have them done, it is very irritating to have them break within days.",3
611,"Good food, good service. As far as menu, it's usual bar food, but it's done well, quite delicious. 
Cold beer and tasty food, can't beat it.
TV's around the place offer variety of sport and occasionally some news.
I'll be back. Recommended!",4
612,"No brainer...best dive bar in South Tampa. Kasey, Mike, Dave, and the rest of the staff are always entertaining and the beer is always cold. PBRs are only $2.50! 

Leave the credit cards at home because they only accept cash at this establishment. Also - it is only beer and wine here. 

Usually the perfect bar to end your night, but you will leave smelling like cigarettes so be prepared to take a shower when you get home.",3
613,"This is as close to Japanese cuisine I get! I'm not a big fan of sushi, sashimi or maki, but I really enjoy their rice bowls and tempura. This location is not terribly busy so you won't have to wait in line for too long. 

They also provide catering options so you can have sushi and maki platters at your functions.

The service has always been good, for fast food. And I know I can keep somewhat on my eating plan when I go here. It's a fast lunch or dinner if you're in a hurry to.",3
614,"Hubbard's Marina Offers 5 hr trips that go out about an hour offshore, fish for 3 hours, and then travel an hour back to trhe dock.  I do not recommend  these 5 hour trips to experienced ocean anglers. Simply put, this 5 hour trip does not go out far enough or deep enough to get to large grouper, large snapper, amerjack, tuna and other larger fish that most of us experienced fisherman are looking for. It is strictly 3 hrs of bottom fishing for grey snapper, hogfish, sand perch, and many other fish that are not very big at the approximately 50 ft depth they fish at on these trips.  I went on 10 trips from December of 2017 through July of 2017, then quit going because I never saw a fish bigger than 6 lbs caught on any of the 10 trips. This 5 hr trip, in my opinion, is a good experience for tourists, and children, but not for serious fishermen.  The pictures of all the huge fish they display on their website and emails, I conjecture, were probably taken from rare instances over long periods of time, and from the more expensive longer trips to deep waters.",2
615,"Really cheap? Pretty fast delivery? Open late? Yes to all three.

Is the food good? Not really. We were either outright unhappy (one dish went into the trash untouched) or just unimpressed with China Star. The fried rice was nothing special, and the egg drop soup was totally bland. Probably there are better Chinese takeout spots around here.",2
616,"I would say if you can avoid going to Petco, try to do so.  The prices are much higher than Petsmart and local pet stores.  Also it doesn't seem as if they have as much of a variety as other stores.  The few good things about this store are it is kept clean and the shelves are stocked.  Unless I can't find what I'm looking for at any other store though, I won't be shopping at Petco for my pet needs.",2

619,"OK St. Louis - let's face it. You're not famous for your pizza. Nor your beloved ""cheese"" (Provel). Yeah - you heard me. With that said, pizza lovers will not starve in the Gateway to the West.

Dewey's pizza has a thicker crust than the cracker crust St Louis is infamous for. They use mozzarella instead of Provel, too. So already things are looking good here.

They have a wide range of pizzas - all tasty. Service is fast and takeout is available. You can even get partially baked pizzas which can be super convenient.

Their crust falls somewhere between STL and NYC - soft but not too soft, with a bit of crunch. Not soggy (I will never understand why New Yorkers think pizza crusts should be soggy). Their crust is pretty good, but it never quite 100% does it for me.

TLDR: solid pizza, good crust, real cheese, lots of choices, vegi friendly.",4

I ran in today to see if someone could take a look at my right passenger front wheel. My tire pressure light was on and I noticed a piece of tire was lifted. I go in and he tells me it's a couple hours wait. Ok, I'll give you that I just showed up so the wait thing is to be expected. I ask the guy if I can make an appointment to come back. He says its first come first serve. Really? When I've made appts previously with other Just Tires? Why not just say you don't want my service? Bottom line? Guy was rude and lacked any customer service. Went down the street to Mr. Tire and was in and out with a replaced new tire in half an hour. Oh, and they appeared WAY busier based on the waiting area and cars in the garage.",1

630,"Sometimes during my work day, I have to take a drive to the Williams Centre on Broadway.  As I am headed to and from, I pass the most peculiar storefront that always seems to have a parking situation on a daily basis.  I mean you can't even see the front entrance on most days, the car park is that packed!  It's a place called Wings Over Broadway and I keep hearing positive things about it.  Today is Saturday: my bud/colleague are out of ideas for lunch, so we figure what the hell.

We phoned in a take away order; I ordered a dozen wings, medium flavoured, he orders a dozen, half mild and half lemon pepper.  I also ordered a batch of bacon cheese fries.  Order is ready in fifteen minutes, I get to the store, surprisingly I land a parking space right in front of the main entrance, and the cashier tells me my order had just come out.  Oh shklit, fresh hot wings!

Back at the office break room, we tear the shklit out of that plastic bag, we are both very hungry.  My medium wings are astounding; sauce is not too runny and not too thick; the taste is somewhat less then what I would consider to be medium- more like half mild- half true medium; but it doesn't reek of vinegar and doesn't drip too much so overall I am pleased.  Added bonus; these wings are fried to crispy perfection.  I appreciate a good crisp, as I have had many wings which absorbed too much sauce and rendered into limp mushy nuggets with bones in them; not these wings.  The meat is moist and steamy, no sign of dry to be found.  

I trade with my bud, one of my mediums for one of his lemon pepper.  It was acceptable, a tad dull perhaps because I'm still under the influence of the medium spice.  Its not fair to dismiss a flavour if I can't taste it properly.  I can never understand why anyone would eat an atomic flavoured wing; all you're tasting is the pain from the capsaicin and not the actual morsel.  

Bacon cheese fries are out of this world; homemade seasoned fries smothered with melted cheese and bacon.  Made me sad that I had six more hours to work instead of kicking back at this chicken wing shack with the giant telly showing the UofA Wildcat game with those fries and a nice cold beer.  C'est la vie...

The verdict?  Why on earth did it take me so bloody long to succumb to crispy sauced poultry Nirvana.  I must spread the news about Wings Over Broadway to my friends and family; they have to experience the goodness I had today. Thank you for a wonderful experience.

My sincerest appreciation to the six chickens who made my dining experience possible.",5

636,"Stopped by here since it was across the street from where we were staying. The only reason this place is still in business is because of the location. We were greeted upon arrival and sat quickly...nothing afterwards was quick. It took at least 15 minutes before for someone came to the table to greet us and ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered at that time as well since we had plenty of time to look at menus. I'm a mahi mahi fan so I ordered it as a sandwich and fried with cole slaw. I'll put it this way, I was so disappointed in it I left an entire piece (came with 2 decent sized cuts of mahi) but the breading was the worst I've ever had, the slaw was mayo based not vinegar based as the waitress stated, and it was possibly the most bland food I've ever had in my 38 years of existence. My friend had clam basket that was mostly fries and equally unimpressive. Son had spaghetti that he said tasted like nothing. Daughter had burger that she said tasted fine and she ate all of it. The waitress didn't seem to know much about anything she served and consistently gave two craps about who ordered what. She would bring out something we asked for and would hand it to someone else at the table. She seemed confused as hell. Long story short this place could have been in our building and I wouldn't eat here again. If you see this place full or a good review I guarantee it's from local clientele. I've been all over the world, this isn't even good for local food. If lack of effort had a taste, this is it.",2
637,Pizza came out barely warm!  Asked the waitress to make another one.  Manager brought back the pizza that they tried to warm up!!!  He took the charge off our bill.  But now the pizza was just gross.  The pizza should have been made fresh!  Ruined my lunch hour!  Since all I ate was one small slice of pizza!  This manager is ill equipped to manage this restaurant!  If i could have left no stars I would have....the 1 star I gave was too much!!!,1

I loved the personal touch of being able to select your own aromatherapy scent as well as type of  music. And it was so nice to get a little chocolate truffle and moist towelette to go (to help with off any excess oil) along with a glass of water.

The studio itself is very beautiful...very warm and inviting. The temperature of the room was perfect and the lighting was perfect. Oh and I also liked that my therapist covered my eyes when it was time for me to lay on my back (that way I wasn't disturbed by any lighting). 

The massage itself (by Emily) was fantastic. I left feeling rejuvenated and very relaxed.

All in all, every little detail was carefully thought out to give you an amazing experience.",5
642,"Neat diner, unlike other diners as it's quaint and has a good feel to it. I had the Yankee pot roast....which was ok....mashed potatoes were just ok and the meat was kind of bland. The veggies were excellent, fresh, not out of a can.  My wife had an omelette which she said was good. Service was excellent.",3
643,"This place is beautiful. Do you want to know the best part? It's free!

The courthouse is open daily to the public, so expect crowds and tourists if you're heading there on the weekend. You can amble around the inside, checking out the paintings and beautiful tiles and various rooms, and then make your way to the top for awesome views. They have an elevator and stairs to the top. The observation ""deck"" is't huge but it has 360-degree views so you can see the ocean, downtown Santa Barbara and the mountains on the other side. Aside from the awesome view the grounds are absolutely gorgeous with lots of green grass and shady trees for a picnic. 

Note: You can park right across the street in Lot 7. Convenient!",5
644,The guys in the deli are slow! All they do is talk and look around trying to avoid work. If you buy produce there eat it fast it does not stay fresh very long,2
645,This is the best pizza in Roxborough!  The ingredients they use are top notch and they have such a variety of specialty pizzas.  I suspect the negative reviews are from competitors worried about their business!  The thin crust reminds me of the pizza I had in Italy.  The have a great deal for lunch or dinner...two huge slices and a soda for under $5.  I try to get there 3-4 times a week.   I can use my laptop in the dining area and also catch up on the news on the 2 HD tv's.    It's a great pizza!,5
646,"They cut down a palm tree I didn't want removed which was NOT marked for cutting!

I was already forced by my neighbor to remove a beautiful palm today because that one had grown a foot into his yard, so I was already upset about that. 

They said they'll replace it, which is good, but the palm took me 3 years to grow and now I have to start over again. 

Now I've got a stump where the palm was, and what if I wanted to put the new smaller one in that spot?

Honestly, I'm livid about it.",2
647,Delicious. Good vibe. A bit expensive. A bit too small. But I just had a really good breakfast so I'm happy.,4
648,"Brulee catered our wedding last December at the Please Touch Museum and it was nothing short of spectacular! We looked at several venues/caterers but hands down Brulee was the best. From the day we went to meet with our coordinator, Kim Rifici, we felt totally at ease like we were working with an old friend. We had a very large guest list and Kim & the crew did an amazing job from soup to nuts. Our guests raved over our food and were wowwed by the building. 

The best part to me, though, was the service. As a bride, its is very easy to get stressed out but Kim took care of everything and was very attentive any time we had a question or issue. I particurly recall an op-ed article in the Daily News soon after we booked our wedding theorizing that the museum would be closing its doors within the year. I called Kim freaking out and she had the chariperson of the museum call me  personally and assure me that I would be celebrating my 50th wedding anniversary there. It was personal touches like that that made working with Brulee and Kim nothing but a pleasure!",5
649,This place kicks ass !!!!!!!!!!!! Drinks are at a great price you can get drunk and still go home with money. People are nice food is real good for a pub style you can smoke out back the place looks sick too. Really nice job with it.,5
650,"I had a cup of crawfish soup which was excellent. They put real crawfish(about 6)in there. It was Satuday night 9p.m. and I was the only person in the bar area which was cool. Great service. I had ""The Ponchatrain"" seafood platter as the main entrée. I liked how the outside of the fish was slightly crusted. It gave great texture. The price of the crawfish soup($7) and the main entrée($24.50) is slightly on the steep side. I don't expect to pay fast food prices but geez could ya lower the price to like $18 for the main entrée lol?",4
651,"From a kids point of view this place is awesome. From a parent/caregivers point of view......eh. 

I got the pleasure of taking a lovely little tot there last weekend. It kept him busy for over an hour and that's a good thing. The pros: kids love it, and they have wifi. The cons: it's a little pricey in my opinion, the food is pricey as well, and I never once saw an employee wipe down a table. This could be a problem for children with severe peanut allergies because they do serve peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Also, they have an area for children under 3 but there is no employee enforcing that rule so there are big kids jumping around with tiny ones.

I noticed they have 2 computer stations and massage chairs for the adults BUT they also have signs everywhere saying children must be attended to at all times so I really don't know when you are supposed to enjoy these ""luxuries"". 

Granted, I'm not a kid anymore (boooo!) but Chuck E. Cheese still seems like more fun.",3
652,"Good food, only ok atmosphere. Typical strip mall restaurant with nothing to make you say wow. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it's not horrible if you're staying at the nearby hotel.",3
653,"First time here, was recommended by some friends. The place was pretty busy when we when on a Monday night which was a good sign.
We were greeted promptly and seated,a server took a drink order right away, another good sign.
They brought out garlic rolls, another good sign.
We ordered different pastas and baked clams, all very good.
This is not a high end place, it's a good neighborhood spot if you're in the mood for Italian and don't want to spend a fortune.
We will return and next time see what the desert menu looks like.",4
654,"I  consider myself a connoisseur of pizza having traveled far and wide looking for the best pizzeria. How funny that one of the best places is within walking distance of my house! It's true, Aldo's has one of the greatest pizzas I have ever tasted. It's the Brooklyn-Style square pizza. It has a plum tomato sauce and mozzarella. Oh my gosh it is addictive. They also make a mean Stromboli Combo! This is basically a pizza with everything folded over on itself: Sausage, Mushrooms, Peppers, Pepperoni! Amazing!",3
655,Egggggghh.  Some weird flavors.  Would like to see a couple classics.  Chocolate tasted funky.,3
656,Last minute late night choice.  Glad we stopped in.   Veggie burger was one of the best I've ever had!!!  The pickle spear was pretty awesome too.  Fries were great and loved the dipping sauce options.  Cool spot.,4
657,"When a Chinese restaurant that occupies an old McDonald's building in Cleveland, OH can serve Chinese food that gives some of the best establishments in Hong Kong or Taipei a run for their money, I really have a tough time giving Guilin here in Tucson more than 2 stars. (Drop by Siam Cafe at 3951 Saint Clair Ave next time you're in Cleveland).

The food at Guilin is certainly better than Panda Express, but would probably be better characterized as Chinese-American, rather than Chinese. If the style of Chinese cuisine you prefer consists of things like egg rolls, shrimp fried rice, egg drop soup, and chop suey, then the flavor palate at Guilin is probably okay and the prices reasonable. If the type of Chinese food you prefer consists of dishes whose names are typically poorly translated into English on the menu, move along.",2
658,My favorite dish here is the two way salad with the Curry Chicken and Grape Chicken salads.  I came here today for lunch and noticed the size of the scoops changed from the medium scoop to a MINI scoop.  It was barely a nibble of each of the chicken salads.  I left hungry and had to order more food to go.  Quit being cheap and go back to the medium scoop.  I feel ripped off.,2
659,"Chains like this should drive Pizzahutdominoslittleceasarspapajohnsetc right out of business.

The secret is to keep your eye on the name when you order.  Barro's Pizza.  Not Barro's Pasta.  The pasta is bland... you can beat their pasta sauce by using a can of crushed tomatoes and skipping the spices.  This is ok, though, because this is Barro's Pizza, and the pizza is solid!

I order thin crust, pepperoni and either sausage, onion, mushroom, or peppers, and the haven't missed yet.  Delicious every time!  I'd go as far as saying it's my second favorite in the area.  The cheesy bread sticks are good too.

It's also a nice place to eat in, and they can easily accommodate groups from the look of it.  Just tell your group to stick to the pizza and pizza-like bready things, and save the pasta for the 90yo grandma in the group who can't have anything with even a little spice.",3
660,"Went for breakfast. Food not bad, service not so good.  Was like pulling teeth to get a refill for a cup of coffee and water.  Then after I did, paid my bill, went to the restroom only to come back and find my water and coffee gone.  

I usually give places two visits before giving up, but this is a one and done.  I can find similar places with better service closer to home.",2
661,Nice to have an awesome local coffee shop. Their Peruvian (must buy a bag) is my favorite.,5
662,"My family and I come to this restaurant quite a few times. Sometimes more than once a month. But this time probably has to be the worst experience we've had. The waitress brought out salads for everyone when we clearly reminded her twice that we wanted two soups. And the soup tasted a little watered down and bland. Our waitress took forever to refill our drinks. When she finally did, she refilled the other two people's drinks and completely skipped past us. The food wasn't uniformly cut so there were big chunks of meat and vegetables. And when it came time to pay, we had a coupon for buy three hibachi dinners get one dinner of equal or lesser value for free. And they wouldn't take the coupon. So they had to end up making us another hibachi dinner on top of all the food we ordered. It was just a big hassle instead of taking the coupon and having the manager explain to us instead of our waitress who clearly had an attitude by the time she brought our check back. Needless to say, we won't be back...",1
663,"Really disappointed. I've been to the Marathon at 18/Spruce and had excellent service, drinks and food. Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.

To sum it up, our server was extremely energetic, but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like ""I don't like food sitting on the table."" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said ""yes!"" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.

I worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.

On another note, the food was not that great.",1
664,We probably got nearly 90+ number 1's for $185! A lot more than the place in Del city for the money. I'll never go anywhere else! My friends in N.Y. go nuts over these live blues.,5
665,"Its ok!! My husband and I love thai food and eat a lot thai food..I had a beef basil stir fry and i don't think won't order again, it just not for me..my husband had a pad Thai it was good but not great.. 
We had stuffed chicken wings for appetizers it was good and different .. Thai tea was delish, place was clean, everyone was very  friendly ..",4
666,"We took a family member who came from Boston, MA & we had a fantastic Bartender who was pleasant & on top of all guests at the bar!  Drinks were great, great entertainment & definitely a place we will visit again!!!  Loved the License Plates on the ceiling. And when we do return we will be bringing a License Plate to add to the collection!",4
667,"This food experience was very well accepted. Claire, our server was awesome and knew exactly what she was talking about. She knew how to dramatically explain all the dishes. Eddie, the manager was really great to talk with. The service was excellent and the food was off the chain! I definitely recommend trying this place.",5
668,"Well, I won't reiterate what everyone said although I may agree.  I haven't seen the infomercials so I cannot comment, but I have tried to buy a car.  If the commercials are anything like the experience of trying to buy a car then I suppose the comments are spot on. After finding a car online, speaking to a well spoken, calm pleasant woman who asked me all the pertinent questions including my price range and my needs I expressed that I was ready to buy the car if it drove well, that I don't like to haggle and want an easy transaction. She assured me the car advertised was in stock, we could work with the price, it could be a quick transaction and I drove from Tampa to Wesley Chapel fully expecting to buy a car. 

When I arrived, the dealership was a zoo!  Music, dj, people darting about-a strange atmosphere for a dealership.  Before I ever saw a car, all the financial documents were filled out, my credit check completed, paystubs printed and I did all this because I thought I was going to buy the car I had agreed to come and see.  Well, I drove what I thought was that car and I liked it. Now it was simply a matter of ""working with the listed price."" 

The first clue (and I should have just left then) was when we finally discussed price, which in itself was chaotic between a man hopping from table to table, my salesperson and the ""floor managers"" the quote came back padded with 3k from the list price for the very same car advertised on their website and which I had already spoken about over the phone.  Hmmm, luckily I brought my laptop.  When I brought this to their attention they were profusely sorry and/or had either confused cars or perhaps this one had extras.  Really, um...ok?  Well on and on it went with a horrible sales manager and I never did get a base price, just fast talking about monthly payments, trade-in values, rebates etc.  Exasperated, I said that I would think it over but really was trying to leave yet they still had my car keys from allegedly testing my car as a trade in.  The whole experience was becoming unpleasant.  I finally obtained my key and of course upon parting another sales manager came over with another deal, albeit better but with some implication that I had to buy the car today, because he had involved the GM to approve this new offer.  First, tag teaming a customer doesn't work and who ever heard of having to purchase something because a salesperson chose to authorize a better price?  Two red flags, not good.  It was a mediocre offer, where we should have begun two hours prior, notice ""two hours""!  I said I would think it over and made a phone appointment with the young sales man (who was clearly being run over by the wheeling and dealing of the sales managers) for the following day.

While all this coming and going was occurring, I simply Googled other Kia dealerships and called Century in Tampa and asked if they had the car I was looking for.  They did and I said I would come down.  As I was leaving the Wesley Chapel dealership, the GM approached me with an even better deal, which I greatly appreciated and possibly would have taken had I not been worn out.  But after three hours of feeling like I had been bait and switched, played to see if I would notice the list price inflated by 3k, having to haggle and all the other nonsense I just wanted to leave. I am at a point in my life when it is time to downsize.  I want a small inexpensive car that doesn't cost a fortune for maintenance because it is not a luxury car.  Equally I just want a simple, straightforward, fair transaction.  I don't want to rob a salesman of his commission, nor do I want to be taken as a sucker.  

I got a better offer elsewhere.  I just need a day to recover from the nightmare of car shopping before making any decision.  My current car is looking better and better. I wrote this review because I generally look at reviews from other buyers first.  Unfortunately I didn't this time.  Silly me.

Update-Next day-no call as scheduled.  Bought the car elsewhere.",1
669,"Did not care for the food, service was mediocre, and parking was dismal.",1
670,The only great thing was the view! The food was okay! Nothing special. They called last call an hour an 15 minutes before they closed. The server was quick the get us in and out. I'm a server as well and wouldn't do half the things they did. Went to the bathroom before we left and when you walk in the people that work there are sitting down on their phone. Too many better places to go than here. It also took 30 mins to get our appetizer!,1
671,Terrible food. Took 25 minutes to get our food. We ordered blueberry pancakes with a side of 2 eggs. Pancakes were overdone and had almost no blueberries. Left with stomach aches and disappointment,1
672,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the US. I went there with my family on our last vacation and I just loved it.

Our waiter, I fogort his name, was super polite and helped us define our meals. The hostess was very kind too and offered us some drinks right at the entrance.

We decided this would be our fancy meal, so we had oysters (fresh and delicious, could have had a thousand of them) and cocktails. Heads up for the margarita and a drink with cucumber (forgot the name).d
They are a kinda fancy place where you need to dress up a little to go to. They also offer catering services for weddings and other events.",5
673,"I honestly have never met such a poor group of bartenders in my life. We went here with a group - a couple of times - mostly because it was supper close to the hotel and too cold to go far.

The first night the bartender actually rolled his eyes at me when another friend showed up and I had to ask him to make another martini.  Seriously? An eye roll?  Sorry not everyone just drinks beer out a bottle. and yes / I tipped well (way too much based on that - but still over 20%)

On the 2 different nights we went there - not 1 bartender smiled or even tried to be friendly. The last eve we were there - while they say they close at 3am at 2:40 they were basically kicking us out - except for about a dozen regulars - who even had their small children running around the bar. - yes at 2:40am  

This place is seriously in need of some proper management and decent staff.",1
674,"Came here with a coworker as she is a regular here and it definitely did not disappoint! I moved from NJ to PA and haven't been able to find a place I loved until today! They got me right in and paid a lot of attention to detail which I so appreciate. Facility is clean and welcoming and everyone here was absolutely amazing. They also have a TON of colors, and do sns powder! I will definitely be a regular from here on out!",5
675,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  I saw ""Gunsmokin'"" 2 nights ago and had a fantastic time!  The actors are very funny and entertaining!!  And the atmosphere is so laid back.  I can't wait to see the next production!",5
676,"Our concierge recommended this place for a late lunch.  We had huge po boys!  My catfish po boy was very flavorful.  The fries that came with it were ""meh"".  We were happy with what we ate, and we were so full for the rest of the day, we didn't have dinner!  We thought that the prices were okay.  One of the less expensive places we ate at in NOLA, but also more casual.  I would definitely pick this place over the food court at the Riverwalk if you're at the convention center.",3
677,What we later found out was that they packed the radiator with sealant. Screwed our car up. Sorry for my bad review for Sunshine Auto. These guys screwed up.,2
678,"We got 50 wings last night. We ate a few and just couldn't believe how small, over cooked and horrible they were. Trashed them! Never going back!",1
679,Kameron just helped us tonight and he was rude and disrespectful to us. They got our order wrong when I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich but they put turkey so we pointed it out to him and he argued with us saying he read back the order to us but he didn't and didn't bother asking if there was anything else we would like to order when we wanted to add items to our order. When he gave the sandwich back to the girl making the food instead of remaking the sandwich we watched her just take the turkey off and put ham and cheese on the original sandwich she had made. I won't be coming back to this location because of the service we just revived. I will also be filing a formal complaint with corporate regarding the disrespect we recived. I have been in customer service for a very long time and would be fired on the spot if treated any clients the way we were treated tonight.,1
680,"Mmmmmmm, my favorite fish tacos in town. Everything is good. Don't waste your time with other drive throughs.",4
681,"This place has become a part of my regular habits. My wife and I both work into the evening, so a kitchen that is open til 12 or 1am is nice to have available. 
The zingers (a kind if buffalo chicken fingers) are almost always delicious and come with a variety of sauce choices. I really enjoy their baby back ribs and my wife enjoys that Mahi is always available. 
This place has a fantastic selection of draft beers and many microbrews and crafts. I thought a chain sports bar would just have the big chain beers, but occasionally they have something I've never heard of. It's always changing with the season as well. 
They take requests with the TVs and even will let you reserve one for a game. 
The place looks like it's still brand new and the decor is sports bar standard. I wish they had some more regular tables as most of their tables are either booths or high tops.",4
682,Atmosphere is casual. Indoor and outdoor seating. Service was good. I had garlic parmesan wings. They were good but a little greasy.,4
683,"I have walked by this place a bunch and thought it was super cute looking and had heard good things about it. So my boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and try it randomly. 

I got the Jewish Coonass which was AMAZING! So good. Unfortunately my boyfriend didn't luck out as well as I did. He ordered the Waffle Couchon. Not so good. The chimichurri sauce is not really a real chimichurri. And he was highly disappointed. However I loved what I got. 

The staff was friendly enough. And attentive as well. Very relaxed environment. 

I think I'll have to go there again with him and really try to figure out what are the good dishes they have.",4
684,We ordered hamburgers and had to take the aweful meat off just to stomach it. Waiter apolgized but still charged us full price plus $.95 per topping instead of menu price of $.50. Also took 13 mins to ring our check up as he waited other tables.,1
685,"OMG YES!

This is currently our favorite restaurant.  Upscale and classy all the way, the entrees vary between el seafood es deliciouso and steak.  Fortunately  their food is way better than my Spanish.

You must get the escargot and bananas foster.  I recommend eating them seperately though.",5
686,"Takoyakis are traditionally cheap Japanese street food, they are pretty much soft dough balls with a piece of octopus in the middle. It's fun, cute and chewy. One would think that it's hard for a specialty eatery like Maru Global to get by, I mean let's face it, Americans are not know for trying stuff that they are not familiar with and how can you really sustain a shop that only specializes in one thing? Though, Maru Global succeeded in breaching the gap between the familiar with the unknown. 

Other than offering the traditional takoyaki, they expanded the concept by offering the choice of chicken and beef in addition to octopus. They also offer pizza balls, cheesesteak balls, spicy shrimp balls, crabcake balls, as well as dessert ones like chocolate banana balls. Other than balls, they also offer curry fries/rice/burritos, yakisobas, miso soup, salad and other little Japanese food and drinks.

The decor is clean, the air conditioning can be upgraded. The portions are a little small. The food itself tastes ok but it's nothing stellar. I keep on wishing there's some kind of okonomiyaki or yakitoris that would make the meal more substantial. Of all the balls, I enjoy the traditional one the best. Their presence is a welcome change for the food scene for sure but I'm not sure a snack food place would work in the States when the motto here is the bigger the better. 

I wish them the best.",3
687,Recently had rehearsal lunch and reserved the Tiki Oasis section.  Food and service were excellent!  Will be sure to plan on having any future events here.  Beautiful location as well.  Thanks Will.,5
688,"Grouper Reuben was fishy and bland. Salad was iceberg lettuce with a few extras thrown in, also unremarkable. We have no reason to return.",1
689,"Open air to the street is nice.

Tables are WAY too small and cramped together. Service was especially slow with half the place empty.

Bacon blood mary had a funny taste to it, I probably got a bad batch.

Food was decidedly mediocre.

Nothing I can really recommend about coming here.",2
690,"Hmmm...neighborhood sketchiness factor on a scale of 1-10 was about a 5.  

But the idea of being able to have a crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside ball in my mouth made the trip well worth it.  I'm talking about big fried falafel balls in my mouth!!!!!

I was surprised to see how busy the place was and the variety on their menu.  We had an order of falafels---a little on the pricey side----6 for $6.99--but I suppose they were a little bit larger than some other places that I have been to.  These were pretty good.

The brother had the gyros with the greek salad.  The salad looked amazing, big chunks of feta, and stuffed grape leaf, a scoop of potato salad (ok this part didn't really look too greek to me, but it was good!), sissy and law and I had the shish kabobs.  Large portions on the platters.  Rice, beans, and a tasty cucumber/tomato salad.  The flavors were spot on and we left with full tummies.

Will definitely return to try some of the other interesting looking things on the menu (fish and wings sound quite lovely)!",5
691,Tried this place because Pho 75 was closed at the time.  A nice suprise. Very clean and the menu was huge.  Im not a pho expert but it was a decent inexpensive meal.,3
692,The best thing on the menu is the peshawari naan.  I cannot believe all these positive reviews.  Folks in Drexel Hill must not be familiar with good Indian food.  Every thing I have ordered from this place has been salty as hell.  I believe they are stingy with the spices and use mostly salt to season the food.  I've had way better Indian food at a hole in the wall in Philly on Chestnut Street.,2
693,"Just dropped almost 600.00 into my Honda, and Jermey becaome my new best friend.

I would and will be coming back to this Pep Boys to have my struts and shocks done.  Ask for Jermey to help you he did a great job keeping me up to date on what needed to be done, and answered all my ""womely"" questions.",4
694,"Been here a couple times. Until this time, I've only ever had the tacos. They are all fantastic. The fish is really good, the chicken is well seasoned, and the pork tacos are incredible. Unfortunately, I just ordered a Carne Asada Burrito and it was not great. The seasoning, sauce, and filling of the burrito was fantastic but the meat itself was really quite bad. The Carne Asada was chewy to the point where I could not actually eat half of meat inside. 

But, Im not one to let one bad experience distract me from an otherwise quality food truck. The tacos are fantastic and I have no doubt most of the other items on the menu would be good. The service is always quick, friendly, and very polite. I have on more than one occasion noticed that the staff greets regulars with an extra smile which is always a good sign. This place a little expensive for a food truck but I'd say its worth it. Its definitely one of the better food trucks in the area. Also, it takes credit cards!",4
695,"I saw a article in the RGJ and decided to go there for lunch.  Very nice staff, odd mix of customers young and old and normal decor for most places now being built (exposed HVAC, not much attention to detail).  The counter seemed inviting for a single diner but behind the counter looked completely disorganized, lots of stuff no one would normally even leave on their counter at home, mostly in dis-array.  Asked a question about the BLT bacon being pre cooked but was assured the bacon was great.  30 minutes later the sandwich arrived, probably the worst BLT I have ever eaten, hard cold bacon, small portion, basically a lousy sandwich.  I had also ordered soup which was good and a side salad which was marginal.  Left the business after spending $14 including the tip hungry, lunch is my main meal of the day.  I think this place has potential, but they need to get rid of the BLT offering and concentrate on providing satisfying portions for people who are not complete vegans or health addicts.  Good luck.",2
696,"Service = pleasant, but not outstanding by any means.

Ambiance = slightly gaudy (unattractive decor and faux flowers), a bit dark without feeling cozy.

Food = disappointingly lacking in flavor and quality.  We ate at the lunch buffet on a Saturday, if it were priced $4.99 instead of $8 I might be less inclined to complain, but it was entirely unexceptional.
I have eaten at many different Indian restaraunts in 5+ countries and multiple cities (most recently Monterey, California where Ambrosia is by far some of the best Indian food I've ever had) and Shere Punjab is one of the worst Indian food restaurants to which I have been.

The naan bread is thin and flavorless, vegetable dishes are significantly lacking in the expected robust flavors and spices, the texture of things (for instance the Saag (spinach dish) seemed as though it came from a can. Blended like baby food. Not a lot of selection.
There were no labels on the food at the buffet.

To say the least, this place did not satisfy my craving (nor my fiance's) for good Indian food and we will not be back.

I can only assume that the people who rave about this place have not had the fortune to eat TRULY mind-blowing, mouth-watering high quality Indian food.",2
697,"I am not sure what to rate this place since the two times I ate there were vastly different.

1st visit:: 5 stars!  Ordered the vegan pulled pork with sweet potato fries and a side of mac & cheese.  Everything was delicious.  I was surprised how good the pulled pork was since I still cannot understand how seitan can be prepared to resemble pulled pork.  Delicious!

2nd visit: 2 stars.  Vegan fried chicken sandwich, seitan sausage sandwich, sweet potato fries and mac & cheese.  The sides were delicious just like the first time, but something was off with both of the sandwiches.  My BF thinks they were old, which is entirely possible since we were both in gastrointestinal hell shortly after our meal.  

Overall, if I were ever in Philly again I would definitely get that vegan pulled pork.  The best part: sweet potato creme brulee.   Straight up heaven in my mouth.",3
698,"This delicious ramen really warmed me up! I had the miso ramen and I loved the flavor profile of the broth. The noodles were tasty and the picked vegetables added a great contrast to the heartiness of the broth that kept the flavor balanced and not too savory. I also added on the black garlic wings because they were having a lunch special (add an app for $4). I was not a huge fan; even with lime juice sprinkled on the top, the fry on the wings was too heavy for me; I wonder if they were twice-fried? While I appreciated the crispiness, I would pass on these the next time around. I would add a caution that the restaurant is small and filled up for weekday lunch by about 12:15; they only have 4 2-person tables, 1 4-person table, and then the seats at the bar. However, this is a great place to come for a solid bowl of ramen, especially if it's cold outside.",4
699,"I've eat here between 50-60 times. NEVER disappointed! I've tried almost every thing on the menu. Food's GREAT! Price is Very Affordable. Service is Always Perfect. If I eat out any where else I find myself comparing it to Cheddars.

Be sure to try the spin-dip! It's the best!

O.K. now I'm Hungry!",5
700,"This place is an amazing authentic Mexican restaurant. The atmosphere is more upscale compared to other Mexican restaurants, but the prices are the same. All of the food tastes fresh. Best salsa around. The ceviche is amazing and fresh, not fishy at all. The best thing I can recommend is the Organic Margarita! Best margarita I have had in my life. They don't use any mix. Highly recommend this place if you want authentic fresh Mexican cuisine!",5
701,Having the worst experience EVER right now..... I hate when servers e somebody and assume ..... I tip heavy I am nice to all service crew and I'm a blogger.... So this not a good look.... The manager was awesome so far....!!,1
702,"Good service, nice clean place, and convenient parking. That's it on the good points. The food sounds asian, looks asian, but definitely does not taste like it. The Thai Lime and Chili had too much acidity and salt. The chicken tasted fine if eaten alone with the rice but when eaten with the veggies it killed my taste buds and I couldn't finish. Also ordered the Pei Wei Spicy Steak with rice. Bland and too much peanuts. Doubt I'll come here again.",2
703,"Olivier's is a bit away from some of the more popular streets in the Quarter.

I wanted to start off by saying that our service was great.  Our server was very ingratiating and took time to get to know us.

Secondly, the dessert was great!  We have had bread pudding after every meal while we have been here and this was, by far, the best.  We also got the bourbon infused pecan pie, which was delicious, especially if you like the taste of bourbon.

The entrees, however, were just average in my opinion.  I did not think the rabbit was very good at all, even though it is supposed to be the house specialty.  The oyster dressing that came with it was very sagey.  

We also got the trio sampler, which had way too much dried parsley as a garnish.  The Shrimp & Chicken Andouille Jambalaya was good, but there was only a small scoop of that.  The sausage, in particular, was delicious.  The blackened fish filet turned out to be catfish, which I do not really care for.  The Crawfish Étouffée had good flavor, but they put it over top of the catfish, which took away from the flavor of the fish and did not let the Etouffee shine - I would have liked to see it separated.  

We got some cornbread with our meal, which was decadent - I know that seems like an odd word to describe cornbread, but it was.  A generous mixture of melted butter and honey was poured over the top of the bread and made it amazing.  

We did not have one, but they have a homemade hurricane that is steeping in a glass cooler with all kinds of fruit - it looks like it would have tasted amazing.  They also had two other cocktails steeping in other flavors that you might want to check out.  

My suggestion is to go to a different restaurant for dinner and then stop by here for dessert on your way back to your hotel.",2
704,"The food is good but please get better quality coffee!!!   It's very weak or just cheap

I have always had a good meal for breakfast or lunch...... The employees are very friendly and pleasant",3
705,"For my 100th review, I was fortunate to rent a movie from Casa Video and found another epic place that has served Tucson for many years.

Free family movie on Thursday, whether you rent another movie or not - how cool is that?  Fresh popcorn to snack on while you walk around the store.

Virtually every movie you could ever wish to see, and if you can't find what you're looking for, they have a wish list that you can request it on.

Although old, the store is kept as clean as possible.  They have many different incentive programs and it is clear that the owner is really into customer service.  Well done Casa - thanks for an epic 100th Yelp Review!",5
706,"Local lower middle class dive bar. Nothing exceptional about the food. Free buffet a couple days of the week. What's in it is pretty much pot luck. Gotta admit that the customers at least during happy hour are very entertaining. Characters welcome. Prices about average. Cheap appetizers Mon, Wed & Fri. A little loud at times, but all
 in all a non threatening place to unwind after work.",3
707,"Out of all the Panda Express chains I've been to, this one has got to be the freshest and most generous. They load their fried rice with veggies and their steamed veggies are fresh and not soggy.  Their meat entrees are also fresh and not as heavy on the oil.  After eating at PF Changs twice, I felt sick.  I can eat a 2 entree meal at Panda and not feel sick. Nice open eating area with lots of light, clean, and fast service. Bonus points for being next door to Jamba Juice!",4
708,"Many people have recommended Jasmine Rice to me because they say the food is delicious and the BYOB factor is an added bonus. I got the Chicken Pad Thai for myself and the Crispy Spring Rolls to share with my vegetarian friend. The food wasn't that great, but the customer service was good and I like how cozy the restaurant is. I will probably go back at some point but would definitely want to try something else on their menu.",3
709,"I am undecided if I like this place or not. I have been a couple of time. However during the storm a couple of weeks ago, me and my BFF ended up here and everything was delicious.  I had fried pickles and the short rib Mac and cheese and have been craving it since. Maybe it was the margaritas but I loved my dinner. The waitress was also so sweet!!",4
710,"In Montecito everything is so Montecito. This establishment is nice, and the food is fine. It is of course expensive but the menu is probably more flavorful than the actual food.
 
We had the burger which was good if a little on the greasy side and a chicken sandwich affair which was drenched in pesto and just fine. We were not so thrilled about our food that we will be rushing back there.

There were plenty of other options on the menu for dinner and I don't know whether these are better, but the bistro fare was not much better than reasonable.

The server was good, friendly and open to questions about this or that. We sat on the small outdoor patio made special by a grand sunset. 

The dining room inside is stony and on the cold side. There is however some great art hung throughout. 

I'm not disappointed, nor do I have a complaint about portion size or menu variety. It was just ok. I probably expected a little more walking in than what is really there.",3
711,"After a long day of sightseeing, shopping and people watching, we searched for food. The hawker outside convinced our group that THIS restaurant had the same food as ""the expensive guys nearby"" but THIS was better and cheaper. We were tired, so we let ourselves be convinced. THIS was the only disappointment in a 3 day stay. I truly don't get the positive Yelp reviews unless the reviewers were tipsy or just don't look for great food. Hilary was our server and started out ok. Menu was pretty standard bar food and Hilary was pleasant enough. Problems began quickly. First diner ordered a burger with mozzarella and Hilary stated there was no mozzarella. We gave her grief for being out of the first thing we ordered...she said it was not a matter of being out of mozzarella, but that the restaurant didn't offer mozzarella. We showed it to her on the menu. She said it was just wrong and they'd never offered mozzarella. Ok, a little weird, but the diner took it in stride and ordered a mushroom burger instead. Hilary was quick to say they were out of mushrooms. First diner is less than thrilled at this point so another diner gave an order so first diner could regroup and re-examine the menu. Second diner ordered a Hang-Over burger. Wait for it....they were out of eggs. What we should have done was get up and leave at this point, but we were tired - too tired to look for a new place. Eventually all five of us ordered something we thought we could live with, but I don't think any one of us was able to order exactly what we wanted because Port St. Peter was out of a LOT of things...on a Friday night???   I can say that the portions were huge and the food wasn't bad, but I've much, much, MUCH better food elsewhere. We finished our meals leaving a lot of food on the table because of the portion size, and asked for our checks. OMG, you would think we'd asked Hilary to paint the Sistine chapel in 15 minutes using only her toes. It took three staff members a total of 22 minutes for the check to be split two ways. Please eat here if you're feeding hungry teenage football players - - portion size would be about right. Otherwise, go elsewhere.",2
712,"This place does something magical and mystical -- you'll leave here heavier AND lighter!

(That is -- you'll feel heavier, but your wallet will feel a lot lighter.)

Stopped by here on a visit to Lumiere Place; figured it was worth a shot.  Didn't know anything about the pedigree of the chef or the place -- just that it was in the casino, I was hungry, and I was there.  Seated quickly (it was late in a Wednesday evening and pretty dead).  Server was attentive, patient to answer the questions I had, and was pretty efficient.

First thing you'll notice when you open the menu - yeah.  Pricey, even for a gourmet burger joint.  You can either build your own burger (starting with a base at around $10 and adding on for extra ingredients ranging from truffles and caramelized onions to good ol' fashioned bacon and cheddar), or pick one of the select ones.  Those come with fries, so there's a slight savings there, since fries are separate for the main burgers.

The fail here is that the burgers are about 75% the size of what you'd expect to get at the local burger hut.  That wouldn't ordinarily be a problem, except that the prices are about 25% higher than what you'd expect to pay at a gourmet/specialty burger place.  Yes, yes, this place is inside of a casino, so you'd expect it to be a little pricier, but it just seemed like it was a premium price for what turned out to be an OK meal.  

This is a place to stop by if you're going to spend a night at the casino with friends and want to have something fun and cool to eat before a night of gaming.  It's not a place to stop by after you're done and looking for something casual and cheap to end the evening.

I think the 3 stars is generous; the staff made up for this visit being kind of disappointing.  I can see where this place would be appealing; it just wasn't what I had in mind as a visitor.  Now I know better.",3
713,"I got the small banana pudding concrete with hot fudge, and it was delicious! The Custard and hot fudge were very creamy--a little too much for liking. I recommend trying atleast once.",4
714,"Mailed a poster-specifically asked the guy to tape the c ends of the poster tubes- he said he would -well the package arrived to the recipient empty-went to file claim-the owner seemed disinterested  in helping me-in fact it seemed he had no clue about anything -no urgency  in providing any customer service- it's been a month and I've been back and forth trying to get a resolution -not a one of the people seem to know anything , follows up on the situation -I've  done everything  I've  been asked to do and provide-terrible service-im about to lose my shit - it's maddening -DO YOUR JOB-IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE",1
715,"This place is so convenient to home, great reclining seats and priced reasonably, BUT .... SERIOUSLY NEEDS A DEEP CLEANING .... .... the smell was so stale and had such a ""dirty"" atmosphere..I couldn't wait to get home to shower and take my clothes off and throw into the wash right away. I had to put my phone light on before the movie started because I dropped something while in my seat and BOY WAS I SORRY .... the food and dirt between the seats and on the floor was incredible... I felt so grossed out the entire time I watched the movie that I couldn't enjoy it .... unfortunately I couldn't change my seat as the seats are assigned but I don't think that would have been any better either....I would not order anything to eat because I saw a roach scurry down the hall between theaters ..... I do know they were sited for DIRTY DINING at one point a while back ... this totally validated it .......The bartender's blouse was so open and low-cut and she kept adjusting it to make sure her tits were showing enough .... she should have been serving next door at the club .... my 11 year old commented on that to me ....That's not right when kids see the help like that in a movie theater . SHAME on the management. I definitely would have demanded a REFUND if it weren't for my father in law paying for a large family group of us to go see Wonder Woman ... the kids were really looking forward to seeing it .... I can tell you I will not be back there .... such a shame because it's not hard to KEEP THE PLACE CLEAN ...I understand there's going to be ""some"" dirt but this was quite ridiculous... Sorry to leave a bad review but couldn't help but to do so ..... PLEASE CLEAN UP ...",1
716,"Eh. This place just doesn't do it for me. Hipster wonderland. Decent breakfast/brunch type fare. Good mimosas. A little pricey for my taste for what you get, but if the line to Pancake Pantry is ridiculous like it usually is, we'll head across the street here for a spot of brunch. The bigger reason for the 3-stars is more due to the fact that you are usually treated like you are in the way if you are clearly not a hipster when you go in. Sort of like you are bothering them... Just don't care much for attitude when I'm paying good money for a basic service.",3
717,Absolutely terrible food and service.  If I could give it zero stars I would.  No redeeming qualities.,1
718,"First of all the interior is nice, really intimate. If you get a chance check out the upstairs lounge that overlooks the street!

SO, to the food... We started with the Poke. I thought it was pretty good, a lot of interesting textures and bites but a little to acidic. The hazelnut and ricotta ravioli though blew my socks off. Only came with 5-6 of them but they were fantastic and rich.

For an entree we shared the Salmon with artichokes, and potatoes. Though I heard the Fried chicken is a marquee item, I felt in the mood for something slightly healthier. The broth served underneath the salmon was delicious and the salmon itself was cooked to perfection. I wish it came with crostini's or something to soak up that tasty garlic-clam broth!

Definitely need to come back and try new dishes AND for brunch. The ricotta ravioli and Salmon are 'must-gets'.",4
719,"I had lunch at Cafe Bosna on a Saturday. There was no wait to be seated, but it did take 15-20 mins to receive our food once we ordered. The wait time wasn't terrible by any means, but the food didn't really justify the wait. I ordered the Polish Sausage Plate and requested mashed potatoes rather than rice. The dish also came with a side salad and pita bread. Though the dish was tasty, it left me with the impression that I could get the same dish and same quality of food at any other venue that offers this type of cuisine. Cafe Bosna is worth trying, but don't expect a mind-blowing experience.",3
720,"Nothing extraordinary, but if you want some simple Chinese takeout, this is the best place around. The food seems less greasy than you sometimes find and the people are super nice.",4
721,"Stumbled across this Jem as I was riding motorcycle to Sturgis and had stopped in Reno
And went for walk along the riverfront.
Had a caprese panini and it was absolutely
The best sandwich I ever had.  Made it a point to stop by on my way back from Sturgis SD
And was not disappointed. Caprese was excellent.  Wish this place was in the Bay Area.
So good will stop here anytime I'm in Reno!!!",5
722,"What can I say? This is a hole in the wall, with a lot of soul! You never know what kind of music is spinning, until you walk through the door. And I have ""clowned"" on their dance floor many times. It's popularity can pack the house at peek hours on weekends, but the neighborhood locals (like me), venture in for short spells on any given day. It's the Saint! Cozy, dark, and sometimes rocking! It's small, but don't let it fool you, local bands perform, local star dj's, and yes a ridiculous Kareoke night (took away a star)!  I must add, there's a plethora of trashy wenches that show up here too (minus another star). But besides that, I like it!",3
723,"I needed two areas of my mouth worked on. I had braces  as a kid and it left me with two areas of gum disease on the front of my back teeth. Food kept getting stuck there. I called them my snacking teeth (ick). Dr. Larrazabal did two surgeries that were pretty intense. She had to add bone to each area and stitch me up. It hurt. It was supposed to hurt. Two days later and I was feeling pretty good. I knew that it would be worth it i the end. The staff called to see how I was doing. That was nice. 
Two months later and the area is still a little sore, but soooooo much better. No more snacking teeth! What will I do when I get a little peckish in the pm?! D'oh!",5
724,"Open 24 hours. Very large portions. Food quality is average to good. Surprisingly wide variety of selections on their menu. Cheap prices. Friendly wait staff; I've seen the same faces there for years. They need to give the place a facelift, and especially update their booths because of wear and tear; the inside probably looks exactly the same as it did when they opened the doors in 1984.",3
725,"So based on our first experience here we were eager to go back  so we did... This hotel always has the nicest associates but this time the hotel roon standards were not good...We were in room 1207 yesterday ...when we walked in the room really smelled like chlorine from pool.  so we left and came back late in evening..our toilet had black stuff under the rim..pink mold on shower tile with mildew scumon all shower hardware yuk!  We actually called downstairs at 1100 pm to have sheets changed in one of the beds because they were soiled including bed skirt and not from us.  At about 1 am we realized our air wasn't working correctly  but we were too tired to do anything about it...The next day I went down to front desk to talk about this I was given 1,000 extra points on my card for my ""incident""... I'm sorry but this room with tax was 180.00 and I really felt ripped off on the Sheraton standard....I was really disappointed  and grossed out.  That's a shame because it is a beautiful property..",2
726,"Decent casual dining restaurant. I only go later at night after 9:00 for happy hour ($5 absolutes and $5 appetizers). Other food is average for the price. Sometimes it feels like the staff runs the restaurant and the managers are just along for the ride (lots or arguing and bickering in the corner). Never tried the salad bar but it seems popular and always stocked. The concept is old and dated trying to re-invent itself...not sure how that's going though. Overall, just average casual dining chain. The highlights are late night happy hour drinks and apps but then again...there's not much in Gibsonton :)",3
727,"I found this spot through Grubhub and trusted the reviews... Although the service was quick, the pizza was pretty gross (totally soggy). 
Sorry Lazos, probably won't try you again.",1
728,"Not bad. The food was competent and the service was as good as we could've asked (1 waiter, large party). The thing is, I was there with a group, and they have this annoying policy where they refuse to do split checks. Now, this would make sense if there were some kind of automatic gratuity for large parties, but there *isn't*, so it's just annoying math for customers to do at the end, which is always both fun and awkward when you get shoved onto a tab with complete strangers.",3
729,"nice place for gatherings and hanging out. Friendly staff. 

Food was OK. Not bad, not good, it just sat somewhere in the middle.",3
730,Hands down the nicest amenities of any Hyatt or Marriott I've ever stayed in. The location is incredible and very close to the airport. I booked a standard room and was treated to what most hotels would call a suite. I will always try to stay at this hotel first when traveling to Tampa!,5
731,just got gouged by their service department...I will never take my car there again...if you want to pay double for service this is your place...they are despicable,1
732,ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!! I swiched after one night to the Hotel Intercontinental a REAL hotel!... The rooms are straight from the '70's no renovation. The happy hour was a JOKE and the food was groosssss. UGH,1
733,I ate here and there was literally poop on the floor. Good food but could do without the doodie,1
734,This place is amazing.. Very relaxing and my daughter loved it she made friends there while we enjoyed the view... and good food.,5
735,I love the variety of sandwiches they have here. I like that they also deliver and they don't take long on their deliveries which was pretty convenient for me being a college student and being hungry at night. There prices aren't the best prices ever but I was able to get a discount for being a Tapingo Club Member which helped a lot because I bought each sandwich for about $3 each which I am happy about. Overall their sandwiches are good and I do recommend eating or ordering from here if you do want a sandwich that is good.,4
736,"Issa NO for me! The dining room was cold. The food was meh. They pile it on here, but I'll take quality over quantity anyday. The ice tea and lemonade were not homemade. They tasted like the powdered kind you mix with water from the can.

As much as I like to patronize black owned businesses, I wouldn't recommend eating here.

On the plus side our waitress, Tamika, was ok.",2
737,"Absolutely the worst meal I've had. The pizza was cold, the gyro meat looked like it was yesterday's offering, red potatoes were cold. $35 with two soft drinks. Upscale setting for awful food. Neighboring restaurants were full. Pita Jungle was empty on a Sunday night.",1
738,"Really like this place,. The location is on the spooky side, but he, makes you feel cool to go somewhere that you may not belong until you step inside this bar.  

I gotta admit im embarrassed, I had been to this bar 4 times before I realized there was an outside patio.  That only made this place a 1000 times better.

I been here when it was a quiet night, maybe a little early and everyone (6 people) was at the inside bar watching Jackass2.5     I been here when it was so crowded , I wished everyone was a big fan of deodorant as I am.   Either way, everytime I came, I had a great time.

Im more of a beer drinker than anything so I cant comment on the mixed drinks but by the looks of it, they appeared to be pretty stiff.

The beer selection is decent too.  On tap is nice, Blue Moon, Magic Hat, Abitas to name a few.

The music they play when a DJ is in has varied greatly.  Walked in once and they were jamming to Reggae,  another time it was a Cure night and the most recent, we were bouncing along to some NOLA Clap.    I havent been here for a metal night, but im looking forward to it.

Did I mention that I really like this place?",4
739,"Ordered the small plate tortellini. It wasn't cooked and had a long brown hair mixed into the marinara sauce. I went back to return the food and was the gentleman behind the countered became argumentative and defensive.  He then begrudgingly gave me a refund and offered no other solution.  Too add to the already terrible experience, he sarcastically wished a 'nice day'.",1
740,"I am no expert on burgers, but I do know what I like. When I saw the Guacamole Bacon burger on the menu, I knew I'd end up ordering it! It was cooked just how I asked (medium), but there wasn't a whole lot of guac on it, so I asked for a side, so I was happy! The garlic Parmesan  fries were not as good as I had expected. Not a lot of garlic or parm throughout the fries. Upon our second go-around of fries, the garlic and parm seemed more generous. I think I can do better if I try something on my own at home! I did enjoy some sweet potato fries and whatever it is that they serve it with, I need to find me some for home. It was a spicy type of ketchup dip,but ran more on the jelly/jam side.

Service was decent. At first our waitress was very present, but then when we needed drink refills (and more fries), she was nowhere to be seen. Otherwise she was pleasant and thought to bring us more napkins before we had asked. 

The wait was about 25 minutes, but there were 5 of us and we asked for a table. Loud place, but not bothersome. I think I'll stick to Five Guys for my burger fix (but I would still come back here, though!)",3
741,Loved his place. Service was excellent and the food was great! The portion sizes were big and you get what you pay for. I loved the Guiness beer soup and the avocado egg rolls. Hope to visit again soon!!,5
742,Food always good some of their waiters are poor.  I hate it when a waiter fails to keep your water and ice tea glasses with something in them.  I also hate that they clear your dishes while your still eating.  Leave me alone and let me eat.,3
743,"Cool spot. Patio vibes af.
Service was slow restaurant empty. 
But the
Hamburger WITH the tomato jam= tits. 
Do it.",3
744,"Large restaurant with a good amount of people seated inside when I walked in. Being alone, I just sat at the front (bar style area). Ordered the pho dac biet ($8.50) and the mango boba ($3.50). The mango boba was tall and skinny. Mango taste was definitely there, but there was so much sugar and I could taste powder. The boba itself was like biting into a stiff snow ball, rather than chewy. The pho featured a flavorful broth with a lot of LEAN meat, which is hard to find in most restaurants. Soft, slippery noodles here compared to stiff in another places. They gave me as much basil as I planned to use. Overall, good pho, but skip the drink.",4
745,"Best brunch in Nashville. Amazing lunch. During brunch drinks are 2 for 1 and they are delicious. The wicked Bloody Mary and blood orange mimosa are my favorites. Red velvet waffle, white trash hash, cheddar biscuits and gravy, eggs benedicts, and Singapore stir fry are all so excellent it makes it hard to decide what to order each time. The burger and fries are amazing for lunch, as are the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, and fried chicken skins with honey Sriracha sauce as apps. They also have a midtown quickie on the menu that changes every day. Tavern never gets old and never disappoints.",5
746,"That horrible angst - you want sushi, but you're not SO hungry that you can do AYCE or want to spend $25 for lunch. So we popped in on a weekend for a late lunch and decided to order a la carte.  I ordered a long roll and a hand roll, a drink and a chocolate mochi (OMG, I am officially in love with these things) and the total cost came to just under $20 with tip.  It filled my belly enough so that I was satisfied.  Had I gone for just one more roll, I probably would have broke even with the AYCE, but I probably would've been so stuffed to the point where I wouldn't have needed to eat anything else all day - not the plan for this particular day.

The rolls tasted fresh and delicious, but the surprise was definitely the mochi - so creamy and tasty.",4
747,"Hands down worst breakfast ever.  Slow, burnt and over priced!",1
748,"It's been better. the food used to wow,, now it's ok. Loaded waffle fries half the size they used to be and wrong ones served, had to be sent back,,, waited,, waited,,, waited,,,  wings nothing special. too many places in Nashville to be average, probably won't be back.",2
749,"Food was good but for an 8pm reservation we were given our table 840pm. What's even better is that we got a 6 seater for an 8 people table. It's gets better, the hostess told us that she can't ask a 2 seater table next to us to leave so we should hover around them to pressure them to leave!! Expect a long wait, bad service from the hostess and good food. Food worth 4 stars.",1
750,"Kudos to Buddy Brew and their roaster as well as their customer service - 5-star on both accounts.

I was so enamored by their collaboration beer with Cigar City Brewing, Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale, that when I went to find a way to purchase it online, I didn't even realize that I accidentally bought the sister coffee roast, Cubano-Espresso beans.

As a home roaster myself, I have a deep appreciation for properly roasted coffee, and these guys nailed it! The taste is slightly nutty forward, and has hints of cinnamon and nutmeg on the backend. Don't let the name fool you - this is nothing like the ""espresso"" roasts you are used to that are mostly charcoal-laden. This coffee is a nice city+ roast, which preserves the nuanced flavors by not over-roasting/burning the coffee.

Try them out, seriously; it will likely be some of the best coffee you've tasted. You can buy the beans in-store or online. They roast them the just before shipping, so you'll never receive stale coffee.

Between their service and quality, they have positioned themselves as my go-to coffee when I fall behind on my own roasting.",5
751,"Simple flavors and well prepared. Understaffed at lunch. Fried Dumplings good, not great but not  greasy. Pork buns really tasty, pork a bit tough. General Tsos chicken delicious. Broccoli room temperature. Rice was fluffy and hot. Unusual to like rice that much  There's a skilled cook back in the kitchen for sure. Overall good feeling in the dining room but only one server for three tables + takeout+ phone. I'll be back. Uneven but worthwhile.",3
752,"I think this place is worse than Basil Leaf. 
This is the greasiest pad-thai, along with Thai Style Cafe on La Palco Blvd. My husband had basil chicken; he doesn't even remember because it was so bad. 
The service? I felt like the step child who asked for food. The only thing great about this place is that we walked to this restaurant from home to have bad Thai. 
This is another place I'd recommend to friends who never had Thai before.",1
753,"We had dinner here while staying at the Intercontinental down the block. After a few days in Nola, we were a little tired of the lines so I turned to yelp to find something nearby without the word 'line' in every. single. review. 

Im so happy we landed on Cafe at the square. We had the French onion soup, fried green tomatoes, alligator sausage, and grilled redfish topped with crab. 

Everything was on point except the veggies served along with the redfish were a little beyond soggy and the potatoes could've been crispier. 

Minus one star because it somewhat lacks a decent atmosphere due to way too bright lighting and something else I can't put my finger on. 

If you're looking for good food, quick service, and great value, you won't go wrong here.",4
754,"Zero fucking rating from me. let me start by saying I don't do these reviews because they're time consuming BUT today I got time cause I'm so pissed off w. How I JUST left! The lady that was attending me knew zero fucking English which I don't mind but she wasn't trying to understand me she just kept on doing her own thing. Mind you it seemed like she had no idea what she was doing but my nails came out decent but I'm NOT happy w. My colors yes I picked them from the book but they came out looking nothing like the nail sample. I'm in a rush so I'm dealing w. These colors for the moment. I got a REG mani pedi w. A $10 add on for their jelly pedi keep in mind everywhere this service is $65 dollars so I should've walked out paying $75 so I went to pay & dude goes $85 in a mumble & asked did you wanna leave something ? I said no cause wtf I'm tryna figure out this quote for something I don't even fucking like ! So I went to my car to try & calculate this & it wasn't making sense. So I go back in to ask for a break down & they tried to tell me gel color for your toes is $20 extra there that sorry the lady just assumed I wanted it instead of asking. After The lady told me the pedi would come out to $35 before starting. So unprofessional on their part for handling this issue but now I see why you all have ""no idea"" what the prices are on hand when asked nor are they DISPLAYED anywhereeee it's because y'all are RIPPING PPL OFF !!! By making up your own prices as you go. Don't fucking go here",1
755,Honestly this is the fanciest medical building I've ever been in. Even the scale is built into the marble floor and concealed. The staff is highly professional and kind. The medical assistant who took my blood was a pro! And I hardly even felt the 2 shots she administered. In and out in under 30 minutes! (Went on a Sunday morning around 9) Will definitely be returning in the future.,5
756,"By far, the worst company I have ever dealt with. I am ashamed an American company can be, and is, so incompetent. I have to make numerous calls, scream and cuss out managers, to get anything done. I have Tri-care health care coverage so I have no other mail order pharmacy options.",1
757,Came in this morning with my girlfriend. We were seated quickly and our server John was excellent. He was very friendly and quick to serve us. He also made sure our coffee stayed full (and we had a lot). Food was very good as well. Look forward to coming back.,5
758,"If you like lobster this is the place. Great prices great service and great food. Very casual dining.

Back again to enjoy the Lobster special w 1  1/4 lb lobster,1 # mussels and 1-2# steamers with corn and potatoes for $19.99. See photo. 
Clam chowder so good as is the Ucon lobster roll covered in melted butter.",5
759,"$11 for 3, count 'em 3!  Ravioli's?  REALLY!?  small plate portions should not cost that much.  It amazes me how people will rave about a place, and not notice (or care) that they're being price gouged.  pizza wasnt that great either, and we had a couple rotten tomatoes on the salad.  there are many better options for Italian food than here.  But, as long as people are willing to pay, overpriced eateries will continue to get away with small portions and big prices.",2
760,"Ordered pizza and drinks at 6:35 pm. At 7:42 called again and told driver was in accident and food would arrive in 10 mins. At 8:25 called again to find driver apparently in another accident and food was on its way. It's now 9:21 pm and too late to order almost anywhere else and I'm in from out of town and stuck at a Doubletree. I will never recommend this place, no customer service whatsoever!!",1
761,"This place was quiet and quaint! In a plaza off of fowler, you really wouldn't know it was there unless you live in the area or go on yelp for brunch type places. The staff is very nice and the chef comes out of the kitchen if not to busy to say hello to the customers. My omelette and my daughters chocolate pancakes were very delicious! I would go back if I am in the area.",4
762,"They answered right away and told me they were busy but could either be here in an hour or refer me to A and R. I asked them to come. They arrived early. Got right in. Super helpful and professional. CHEAP! Only $40 for mobile call and $15 to break in and $3 for key copy. 

I'd use them again.",5
763,"Throughout the last few years this mall has really gone down hill. Most of the stores my family and I regularly shopped in are now gone. There is only one store I still go to when I need something and can't wait for it to be shipped, and that is Things Remembered. They are great, but I always feel uncomfortable in the mall itself, and the security is obviously terrible. My husband and I witnessed a car being broken into and tried to find security, only there wasn't a guard to be found. We haven't been back since.",1
764,"Consistency seems to be a major issue here.  Sometimes, their food is awesome.  Other times, it tastes like it was cooked in a microwave.  One time, the chicken in my sandwich was still pink in the middle.  Service is sometimes fantastic, sometimes horrible.  I can't be bothered anymore to pay the prices they charge for food that is that damn unpredictable.",2
765,"Great food and drinks.  Was on the top of my ""go to"" list until they removed the Trout from the menu.  Still, you're sure to find something delicious. The Creme Brulee was perfect on our last visit...as was the special - Striped Bass.  Only disappoint I've ever had here was finding the Trout missing from the menu!",4
766,"This is absolutely the dirtiest, most poorly equipped restaurant I have ever been to.  The floor is uniformly sticky.  The tables are filthy.  Do.not.look.down.  You won't like what you see.

We ordered two burgers, two drinks, and a 50/50 basket of fries and onion rings.  The burger: easily the tastiest burger I have found in Nashville.  Too bad they didn't have half the toppings that I requested from the menu board.  The 50/50 fry basket took 20-30 minutes to arrive.  When it did, the fries were amazing, the onion rings were colder than the soda we were drinking.  

The staff was friendly, and did their best to provide good customer service, which is why they got a second star.   

This place has the potential of being a great burger joint... just as soon as they invest heavily in bleach and Brillo pads.",2
767,"This review isn't based on an overnight stay at Matrix Hotel, but based on attending various conferences at the hotel.  I like the open lobby with lots of seating when you first walk in which is great for a quiet area to make a quick phone call or to wait for someone.  Closed to the front desk, there's a small display indicating what events are taking place in what ballroom.

Upon heading up the stairs, there's a hallway to the left or right leading to the rooms.  I have attended events in the rooms to the right.  The layout is great to allow for registration tables to be set up and the washrooms are close by.  The washrooms are nice and then have comfortable hand towels and the soap well stocked

The room was set up with tables and chairs and a podium and table at the front.  It's great there's a large screen for a PowerPoint presentation as well.  For the event, there was light food and beverages at the back of the room.  The staff were working hard to make sure the cups and plates were promptly removed and ensuring there was no shortage for people to use.

On a warm day, the temperate in the room was cool but comfortable.  The details were taken care of and made for a comfortable and great event.  Thanks Matrix for always being a great venue for an event!",4
768,"I rented a trailer last week and the trailer was broken. They realized this and set me up with a different trailer and did all of the paper work without me in the building. When I return the trailer, I notice a $60 charge for the insurance (I did not choose the insurance on the initial trailer). I called and the girl told me that the general manager would call me back and refund the money. He never called, and I had to call 3 different numbers before getting ahold of him. When I finally did talk to him, he was VERY rude and told me that the insurance was an option that I had to have picked. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Charles Short, the GM, needs a lesson in customer service.",1
769,I went here for breakfast this morning. Service was good. I would say the food is okay for what you get. I ordered the pancakes and a side of bacon. $19 later I was full but neither was out of this world. Maybe I'll see if dinner is bettet,3
770,"Decent food, nice outdoor courtyard seating, live music was playing I'm not sure if it's every night but they did last Friday nite. The alcoholic drinks aren't all that bartender could do better. Unsure of the dress code most people we were dressy.",3
771,"I have to be honest, I was a little skeptical going into the 10-minute workout because all my life I've never been told you only need to workout 10 minutes a week. After doing my first 10-minute workout with Quantify Fitness my mind was blown! I left feeling like I ran 6 miles and then some. I was sore for days after and it honestly was the best quick workout I've ever done. I'll definitely be going back!",5
772,"Visited here for the first time ever today, I really liked it alot! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have near as much variety as Whole Foods. They had some awesome deals on meat for a Tuesday, I think they have these type of specials every Tuesday. I will definitely be back!",4
773,Food was decent but service was absolutely horrible. We ordered Sushi and a dinner plate and it took forever to get any help for drinks. If you want quick and crapy Japanese food I recommend this place.,1
774,Class schedule met my needs but the yoga studio is pretty noisy sometime ( from the sound of upstairs).,4
775,"This place sucks,$4.75 for a beer..Tight slots.Been to Vegas ,Foxwoods,Turning Stone and this place is the worst.",1
776,"I went here on a whim, searching for some place to eat in downtown STL.  Some locals at a bar across the street recommended it over another bar & grill.  I was not disappointed! 

The burgers, sauces, fries, and service get high marks in this place.  The server refused to bring an entrée to the table due to poor quality.  

For beer drinkers (I'm not one), the list is huge.  The soda, however, got high marks.  Rather than offer the popular brands, Bailey's serves up some local bottlers.  

Love the industrial feel of the atmosphere with the open kitchen and wrap around balcony seating.  

You don't find such a unique variety of home made options around these days.",4
777,"Our experience was slightly better than average until the last night of our stay. That night, at 2am, I complained to Jim the night auditor about a noisy room nearby, and he said ""I'll take care of it"".
But the noise continued, and I had two additional conversations with him between 2:45 and 3:30, in which he subsequently apologized for not being able to take care of it.
He refused to call the police to have the noisy guests evicted, he refused to call his front office manager for assistance, and he made me feel that because the noise emanated from a room that was part of a group of many more rooms that he'd simply rather upset the single quiet guest than to upset the noisy 'VIPs' from a larger group.
I wrote my original 1-star review at ten minutes to 4am and although the noise has abated somewhat there is still loud voices and laughter that wafting up from the courtyard every few minutes.
Hopefully I can get a few hours sleep before I have to drive out in the morning, and hopefully I'll be rested enough to make it to my destination in one piece.

So, Jim may have done his best and failed that night. However, after explaining the miserable night I had to Front office manager Beatrice, she was able to have Hotwire refund a portion of my total payment due to the noise problem, and that leaves me with a much more favorable view of the La Posada team.

Also, note to prospective guests: the WiFi here is not quite of sufficient bandwidth to accommodate all guests during periods of high occupancy. So if you need sufficient bandwidth for streaming, etc, that may be an issue.",4
778,"Great place to go if you like inventive, or just gin, cocktails! The bar and lounge area are both very cute and cozy. Everything was mediocre after. Sat at the chef's seating area at 9pm Saturday night and it took over 2 and a half hours to get in and out. Waited 15 minutes for our drinks. Our server was extremely flakey. Waited over 20 minutes for her to buzz on back to us with the check...after 11pm. Not worth it.",2
779,"If you're looking for a cozy, romantic atmosphere with a touch of traditional Greek comfort, this is your place. 

Zorba is snuggled in Fairmount in Philly, but something about the location makes it a hidden gem. Not only are you able to get away from the trendy side of Philadelphia, you can also find a nice neighborhood to enjoy quality food. 

I had the pita and hummus for appetizer- absolutely delicious.  For dinner, Avgolemono (lamb shank with artichoke sauce) I have never had lamb cooked to perfection. It was so moist, the side of vegetables and rice was so filling. Totally worth the wait for it to be cooked. (Tip: If you want to try this dish, make sure to call ahead and check to see their availability for lamb). 

I must say, Greek coffee really hits the spot. It has a very rich, chocolatey taste to it. And the amount served is perfect for ending your meal. 

I assume the restaurant is family owned and operated, including the waiters. We had the same waiter the two times we went and he was VERY accommodating to where we wanted to sit, given the restaurant isn't that spacious. Here's one of the things I really appreciated: The restaurant is always busy, and there can be long waits for when you come without reservation. However, while you are dining waiters do not rush you to get out or to leave once you've signed the check. 

Cannot wait to go back!",5
780,"This place serves up dreck.  I don't know what these other Yelp users see in it.  From flat, largely flavourless pho to hard uninspired spring rolls, the food at Pho Anh Sang is not good.",2
781,"Possibly the best-kept secret in Chinese food in the area. The food was amazing, and the service was great. I was there for lunch, where there were two menus available: the ""regular"" menu, featuring the fare that Americans are used to seeing at Chinese restaurants; and the ""Chinese"" menu, with some things that might not be so familiar to locals. It was from this latter menu that I ordered lunch, being the intrepid soul that I am, and I was not in the least bit disappointed. In fact, I was very pleased with the shrimp-and-egg dish that I had (especially after I added a bunch of hot oil!). One of my friends ordered some beef chow fun to-go for the family, and we tried some of that, and it was incredible. I pretty much can't wait to go back for more. Give it a try!",5
782,"I will never eat here again. I ate here a couple months ago and it was average (maybe three stars) but after this last experience they have been demoted to a one star in my eyes. We ordered the chicken saltimbocca ($23) and the chicken picante ($15) each with a side of linguine w/ the garlic butter sauce and each came with a side of escarole soup and side salad. We ordered this for pickup so they then told us that we had to bring them containers to put the soup in because they didn't have any. And I dint think this was just because they ran out bc my gf remembered this happening in the past. 

So we picked it up after we took out money at the Wawa because they don't take cards. Um its 2011, everyone uses cards. Get with the times son. We finally got the food back to my place and when we opened it up we found out that they gave us marinara sauce instead of the garlic butter and I'd usually let it slide but I was really in the mood for it and I'm tired of not getting what i ordered. So I called them up and the lady that answered the phone gave me to the guy that took the order and I explained that we didn't get the right sauces and he said in a very rude tone ""well I didn't hear your wife or your girlfriend or whoever that was say that you wanted that sauce. Its an extra 2 dollars for that sauce. I can make it for you and you can come back up and it will be 4 bucks"". I was so caught off guard and didn't know what to say I just said ""no I wont be doing that"" and hung up. After I hung up all the great comebacks that I missed out on. I felt like George Castanza in the one episode where he thinks of a bunch of witty comments after the fact. Unfortunately I wont have another chance to hit him with my comebacks because I'll never go back. 

Also the food tasted like tin foil. Sounds awesome I know..",1
783,"Went there with 3 other people. Two got the ahi tuna tostada, one got shrimp and brussel sprouts, and I got the releno natural. The ahi tuna was done just right, the shrimp was huge & with homemade red sauce, and chile releno was very tasty.",4
784,"Skip it! Not worth the $27.50. The cruise itself is really boring; all you can see is trees on the side. The narrative tells you it was a battlefield and there are two plantations and colonial buildings as well but you can't really see them. There is Domino's sugar refinery and a huge natural gas plant - all steel, nothing really to see or enjoy. The steamboat doesn't give you a special feel, it's like riding on any other boat. The music is really good indeed -probably if they didn't have it, nobody would come.",2
785,"Second night in a row at 2 Different LaQuintas, both times I am questioning whether the room has been cleaned properly, coffee stains and cup rings at one, and when I opened the door on the second, a piece of the heating/AC unit laying on the floor on one side of the bed and a empty to go cup on the other....needless to say, extremely disappointed",1
786,I believe the owner greeted me at the door. She was rude and threatened service if I didn't get gel. The quality received is not worth the price.,1
787,"So I've been to Jones a couple times now and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere. Got the shrimp and chicken dumplings and there were four of em for 8 bucks with soy sauce that just kinda resembled plain old soy sauce. I got the crabcake which was a good size and tasty. Fries that came with the dish were nothing special. Service was fine and I'll probably be back, I just need to figure out what entrees are worth getting.",3
788,"Great place to stay if you want to be on Bourbon street.  The staff is really hospitable and didn't fail me on food choices.  The room is nice and big.  However, I stayed in room 263 and thought it was perfect because it was not a room that faced Conti.  I was wrong because it was closer to the vending and ice machines.  The door/wall was thin enough that I heard conversations in the hall next to the vending machines.

I would have rated the hotel with 4 stars if it wasn't for the thin walls.",3
789,"Extremely disappointing experience. Upon entering, I asked one of the store workers about their recommended pastry. Appearing extremely confused, he had no idea what to recommend and left me to make my own decision. After selecting my various items on my own, I was presented with a total of about $13.50. In pulling out my credit card, the same cashier let me know that they have a $15 minimum for all purchases. His suggestions were either to used the ATM with ""high fees"" behind me or to buy something additional.  I asked him where the minimum was posted - he responded that it wasn't. I promptly asked for my credit card, abandoned my purchase and left.",1
790,"The food is good, cheap and fast.  It's texmex, not traditional street taco fare.  Wish they had a gf menu... it doesn't seem hard like it would be hard to offer the same tacos on corn tortillas.

793,"We love, love M.L. Rose! I am a huge beer fan and the flights are so fun to choose and try. I love the neighborhood hangout feel, not too hipster, not too old....just right! We always have awesome service too. My hang up can be the food. Wings not quite crispy enough, burgers not cooked to taste, spinach artichoke dip just meh. The steak and Gouda was flat out gross - big fatty slab of undercooked steak on bread. We were told it is leaving the menu, but they should have removed it long ago. And no visit from the manager when the sandwich was returned, which was a little underwhelming. We will be back, we are big fans, but please get your kitchen together so I can have my fav burger in town cooked just right :-)",4
794,It was OK here. Ive had better food. The staff did a great job. I'm sure I'll give it another shot one day.,3
795,"Great selection, amazing volume of stuff to choose from. Make up, stage craft items, costumes and more... all in a Deco warehouse tucked on a side street behind Datz.

The only downside was a counter girl that simply would not shut up. I couldn't escape her and finally left because she was so damned annoying.",4
796,"I know it's shameful, but I went over 10 years without going to the dentist. I didn't have any problems(or dental insurance) so I just didn't feel the need. Well...turns out I had 4 cavities :/ In the past, I dreaded dentist visits. Dr. Nabors has such a gentle touch, not even the needle hurt! And it was affordable enough that I could pay with cash. If I had known that going to the dentist didn't have to be scary I would've gone years ago. Now I'm in every 6 months for a cleaning like a good little girl and everything is great!! Andrea is my hygienist and she is gentle as well. I'm a big baby and she deals with the weird faces I make. She also whitens my teeth and they look sparkly and stay white for months after!! The office staff is always friendly and accommodating. Love this place!!",5

Again on 12/31 the car would not start so I brought it in again and was told the battery was bad and it would be $150 to replace it.

I had forgotten my green card and they were unable to give me points for the two expensive breakfasts I had. It's not worth the price anymore. I will go back to frequenting Le pain quotidien. It has less options but the food is organic, tastes better and about the same price now!",2
802,"I'm not sure if this is the right one because there's about three of them in the same location  but the one on New Orleans/Bourbon st is shit. They I.D'ed us at the door like EVERY place in NOLA and then the guy asked my friend what she wanted then he ignored her after her request. We all looked at each other and was confused because he came over to me then said may I help you and I said yes my friend just asked for a hand grenade he continue to ask me for my ID and I kinda just looked at him because the guy at the front just checked all of our IDs. As I started to take it out he points at one of his employees from outside and says come make HER her drink ( as he points and yells at my friend) keep in mind we just came outside so it's not like we were intoxicated or anything for him to refuse the service.  We just was really confused then he told another employee ""show these girls were the other tropical island  is goodbye"" show these girls where the other Tropical  Island is. Extremely rude and inappropriate even the other doorman apologized for what ever was happening and said don't mind him. What makes it even worse I'm pretty sure it was the Manger that was carrying on in such manner.",1

Instead we got rice and beans, which were highly bland and disappointing. The tacos were good, but just good. The duclaw beer was fabulous, and we ate outside on street (not a pretty street I might add) but it was less than $30 and it was satisfying, but not exciting or amazing by a long shot; not inclined to return.",3
805,"This review is for Sunday brunch only. The inside of the inn is beautiful and historic, particularly the Library which is where our large group was seated. The service was great. The brunch offerings, however, were not so impressive. At $26pp, a waffle station would have been nice. Or pancakes. If you wanted eggs, you had to wait at the omelet station. A type of breakfast meat other than pork bacon would have been good also, e.g. turkey sausage, turkey bacon. The vodka penne, chicken francaise, potatoes and green beans were all lacking in flavor.  The cookies and other dessert items were not worth the calories or fat content.",3

Other than that the coffee is good and so is the food.",3

Awful !

I ordered the Greek lasagna after our waitress told me it was filled with feta cheese  beef and  spinach . I was given regular lasagna and asked where was the spinach and feta was and she said it doesn't look right it's Italian lasagna took it back to the kitchen came back and said the cook said it was Greek lasagna not sure what they were doing getting rid of old food maybe so I asked for a spinach bacon Swiss omelet instead it was more like scrambled eggs with some sort of gross hard weird cheese like velveeta not swiss

My daughter ordered a hamburger and mashed potatoes which she didn't touch the potatoes were old dried up instant potatoes

 very gross !

My husband and older daughter both got fried shrimp and baked potatoes 
They barely touched it 
 
You get free dessert  as well my daughter loves cake she chose chocolate cake and said it was gross  
 
Very low quality food not worth the 50 we gave them !",1
810,"For a seafood restaurant at the edge of pear expectations should be set high. My wife and I have come here 3 times now and ordered different plates off the menu each time. This last time we ordered cioppino, clam chowder, and a crab salad sandwich;
*Good - clam chowder (excellent flavor and consistency) would order again.
*Not great - cioppino (lacked flavor & a variety of sea food/lack there of) would not order again
*Pass - crab salad sandwich (lacked flavor, mayo was overpowering, crab flavor was almost non-existent, side of onion rings too greasy) - would not order again 
The overall experience is okay, better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean, inside is very small. Service is good but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated. 
Is it worth a visit? Yes, but be selective of what you order as the menu tends to be a hit and miss.",3
811,"The Epcot of Liquor!! Eh...not quite. More like the Walmart. 

So I don't mind that you can actually find some hidden gems on their deeply discounted sale rack. And I can't argue with a $1.00 bottle of white wine to keep around for nasty red wine spills during get-togethers (instant stain remover). However, you can spend hours looking for one damn bottle as they just stack boxes at random. Their staff really isn't helpful in find or suggesting liquor. I've had several staff members look at me like I had three eyeballs when I've asked for common wine brands or varieties. 

Beer selection here varies constantly and isn't great to start with. You can buy plenty of standard beers there, but their craft brews are few and far between. Their beer isn't really consistent. ACTUALLY, nothing here is consistent. Their selection is constantly changing (which wouldn't be a problem if they weren't constantly running out of some pretty basic wines and beers). Their times aren't consistent (Sometimes they stay open til 10; sometimes they close 15-30 minutes early). Their staff isn't consistent (Sometimes, they're at least nice, even if they can't help me find what I'm looking for. Buttt sometimes, I swear the fact that some poor soul is waiting in their checkout line is a fate worse than death for their cashiers).

When they are open and actually carry what I'm looking for, I can look past the rude staff to pick up a few bottles or cases for my home bar at a pretty great price before popping back to the Puritanical land of PA liquor/beer separation.",3

While I was there, a guy came in from a few hours up north talking about how he couldn't wait until he came back to SB so he could get some suits altered by Lee since the tailors aren't as great where he's living now.  Something similar happened when my husband went in.   He makes people happy enough to keep coming back for more.  That's always a good sign.

What you really want to know is if he's any good, and based on the work he did on my dress and Mr.'s suit, I'd say he does fantastic work!  I have a few other articles of clothing that have been cast away to the deep, dark, scary corners of my closet that I'd like to have him resurrect.",5
814,"I'm from New York City so I'm used to omelets and oatmeal for breakfast and that's not an easy thing to find in New Orleans. I can't even fathom eating fish for breakfast. I found Cafe Fleur de Lis and saw that it had a normal menu so I figured I'd try it out.

I called to find out if the oatmeal was made with milk or water and the person who answered the phone had no idea and was completely thrown for a loop. When I got there I asked if I could get the farmers omelet with egg whites and my waitress had no idea (it turns out you can). My omelet wasn't' bad, but wasn't amazing.

The person I was dining with ordered the pancakes and you have a choice of a few things that you can get with them, so he chose bananas. Again, the server had no idea what he was talking about when he ordered the pancakes with bananas. Then when they came to the table she held them up and examined the plate because she thought that they had made them and forgotten the bananas (they didn't). Also, the pancakes were alright, not great.

I wouldn't go back here. If you're in the area go to the Camellia Grill down the street. It's so much better.",2
815,"My husband and I went with another car, but I thought that Lou deserved a shout out for his customer service. He was personable, yet professional and never pushy. I've had issues with having service done on my car here a few years ago as well as others have complained about.. but if you are looking to get a new car, ask for Lou.",4
816,"2.5 Stars 

Located inside Reading Terminal Market, there are many food stall to choose from, but Beck's is the only one with Louisiana style foods.  I came here for lunch after reading some pretty good reviews.

Decor:
Like many of the food vendors of Reading Terminal, they presentation is not the focus.  It was still a fairly clean cooking area and everything was labeled properly.  There was nothing to really complain about regarding the decorations given the surrounding food stalls.

Food:
I ordered the beignets which are only available on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  It was around $8 for a bunch of fried dough balls with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  They were freshly made to order and came inside a plastic container.  The dough itself was rather dense and did not have the light and fluffy texture that I was hoping for.  They were not as good as I had hoped, but I would be willing to try the savory options in the future.

Service:
The lady who took my order was really nice, but the lines leading up to the register can be quite confusing.  With so many people walking around the market and stopping to look at the food, it was hard to tell who was waiting for food and who was just standing around.  After placing my order I was told to wait to the side, but the food took a while to come out.  Luckily, they were piping hot when I received them, which makes up for some of the wait time.

Overall, the dessert options can be skipped.  I would try the gumbo and jambalaya in the future if I ever came back.",2
817,"I never realized how close I am to this amazing spot!

I wandered in one morning and discovered what I've been missing. Cheap, tasty bagel sandwiches; good coffee & lots of tables. (If you're going to eat in check that there's a spot open before you pay, because I was lucky to find a table!)

Good, quiet & calm atmosphere for studying/reading and everyone I encountered seemed friendly!

I will definitely be back!",5
818,"Although the chicken is always very good, there was a ""sulky"" male employee on Sunday, Jan 1 with a puss-face putting my package together 16 pc grilled chicken meal.  Out in the open he was complaining about work.  Honestly, if he doesn't like working there or the pay, the manager should allow him to make a decision, change his attitude or leave.  This doesn't leave customers with a positive feeling about the place, especially when he didn't load all that was supposed to be in my order.  Where's the rolls/biscuits?  Pay attention, it doesn't cost anything.",3
819,"Great addition to the neighborhood.  Friendly employees, light and open space and an extensive menu.  Bonus for Cycle beer on draft.  I haven't tried the pizza yet, but everyone I have spoken to has given it positive reviews.  Enjoy the ability to share small plates and try various items.",5
820,"Food and coffee are great. Just have 30
Minutes to stand in line and wait for the ONE cashier to make change. Either they fix this and add another cashier or they will be dead. Shouldn't have to wait for one cashier while 5 other folks stand behind the one cashier watching the line grow. Adds other till!",3
821,"Love Zac's Burgers in Aston so since I was in area stopped in for lunch here. And a snack later.

Ordered rhe Zac Pac 4 burgers 4 boneless wings added fries and fountain soda for $19 total

Clean friendly. Not all TVs had sports on them. A positive for me.  Staff was fast to wipe tables when customers left. 
Mens room clean and stocked. Positive",4
822,"Iced Irish cream coffee was exactly what I needed. Free wifi, chilled place. Outdoor seating. Not freezing cold like other cafes around.",4
823,"Location: near the University, but I wish it was a bit more central, but the fact that I'll drive 20 minutes to North reno for this place should speak volumes.
Ambiance: mellow and retro. What I expect from the late 80s early 90s California beach scene. 
Food: I love the food, it's unique but so tasty with a large variety. There is literally something for everyone. I love the pig Kahana. And the surfing  cow. This place also has a good selections of local and micro brew on tap
Price: Be warned it is a tad expensive, but the regular size is great for one person and you could share a large if you and a friend are craving the same thing.
Artcade: yes I spelled that right, it an art gallery and throwback retro arcade games. It's enough to nerd out at for a few minutes. The best part is you can actually play these arcade games 
Service: This is what drops us to the four star rating.. They are a bit slow and not the most friendly people, not mean or bad, just mediocre, doing their job.
Overall: 4 out 5 and highly recommend with price and service in mind :)",4
824,Could contend for the best thin in STL if they would give you an option to have something other than that awful provel cheese.  Won't come back.,1
825,"The grits and mac and cheese were incredible. Hot chicken sandwich was pretty bad. The chicken was so over cooked and parts of it were inedible. Won't be back, there's better BBQ elsewhere.",2
826,"Meh, expensive and uncomfortable seating. One family relocated to another table when one became available, the mother said she expected more than a stool as their bill was going to be $300.  They were sitting on metal stools like your Grandpa has in his garage. We ordered the Sunday fried chicken dinner for two. It was to be a whole chicken and sides. The fried chicken was good but we were served five legs and two wings, one strange bird. My husband said it was built for speed, lol.  We won't be back. Adding basil to everything doesn't make it italian.",3
827,"Great idea, not well executed.  We ordered three pizzas.  After a while they brought us one, obviously not one of our orders, we sent it back.  In a while two more pizza's came out which were obviously ours.  A long time later still not third pizza.  We followed up and it was no where to be found.  Strange as we watched it being built. 

We finally got a replacement ordered.  They still didn't deliver it, had to go find it ourself.  

While there, we observed several people upset with their order.   One table they brought three pizzas to them and each was wrong.  I think our pizza was put in the pick up area and someone at home was pissed about the pizza they got.

The problem seems with lack of management.  There didn't appear to be anyone in charge looking over the process and staff.

I would  not recommend Pieology until they they get their act together.  At least stay away on busy days and times.  

Food quality appeared ok to me, but that is subject to taste.",1
828,"I went to get a ""quick"" carryout of queso and chips at 7:30pm on a Thursday night. They had 2 tickets hanging although they did have a full dining room. I waited to get to the register only to be ignored by the girl ringing tickets. When she finally got to me she said ""how many in your party?"" I told her I just needed a carryout. A frazzled presumably manager interrupted and told me I had to go to the bar. So I go to be ignored once again. When the bartender finally greets me she doesn't apologize for ignoring me or my wait, only ""what can I get you love?"" 
I told her I just needed a chips and queso to go, she says ""of course"" under her breath. What is that supposed to mean? Anyway, I watch the expediter make it, and wait, and wait, and wait.... The manger asks if I have been helped yet. I said just waiting on my chips and queso, again I wait. The bartender finally goes over and the expediter asks, ""is that all he needs?"" Finally I get my order that should have taken less than a minute, but took 24 mins. 
The queso was fine which is why they get 2 stars, but the service is AWFUL.

Update: owner Craig asked that I email them and they would like to speak with me personally.  I emailed them and after 5 days have still received no response. The bad taste I had for their service is now worse.",2
829,"Been a patron since they opened and Dooney's used to be awesome. Over the past few years service and food quality has declined. Tonight, I get it that it's St Patrick's Day, but the bar service was absolutely horrible. On a night where you would expect the alcohol to flow, it creeped. Our apps made it to the table before our first drinks and we were done with the apps before my drink made it. Not the servers fault at all. This is totally the sign of a horrible bar staff. Drinks should be FIRST. I dont care about comp'd drinks. I want good overall service. I do NOT recommend Dooney's on a high volume night.

The Guinness Irish Stew was horrible and one of our meals came out cold. The stew looked like it had been sitting for a day and the gravy looked broken ad store bought. Terrible!",2
830,The Retreat is an occasional stop that makes for a good happy hour meeting place. It's got the relaxed atmosphere of a neighborhood bar early on. It's also a college bar so depending on when you go the vibe can be different. The bar allows smoking and serves no food but you can order from the place next door.,3
831,"This is a good classic  new york Pie, i should know im from Brooklyn,   My brother says it decent, then again he lives in Chicago where they love  pizza soup!!! ""deep dish"":-o",4
832,"If i could give 0 stars, I would. First, it took 2 hours and 15 minutes for them to even show up, and that was after I called grubhub to see where they were two hours ago. Then, the order was supposed to be a sicillion pizza. This was much more $ than a regular pizza. This was a regular pizza in square shape. The sauce was terrible, the pizza was cold, and it looked thrown together. There was only pepperoni on one side of the pizza. HORRIBLE. Never again. Never.",1
833,If i could give this place a zero stars I would. What a waste of my time. We waited for a seat. Our server... female with dark hair... never told us her name...never brought us bread.... I asked her 3 times for plates when the other server finally brought us bread.  She screwed up my kid's calamari with no parsley on it and never put in my order or my husband's order...we literally sat there for over an hour with no food. I finally asked for the manager and he told us then that he was making our order the priority for the chef...I got up and walked out. Im a chef. I would never have sent calamari with something someone specifically asked for there to not be on it. The server put the calamari in as an appetizer even after i told her it was my daughter's diner. What a terrible experience...i will NEVER eat at this restaurant again..and i will tell Everyone I know what a horrible place this is!,1
834,"Just any-old-bar.  I went for a networking happy hour, and the service sucked...I mean, they kept giving drinks to the wrong tables, etc.  Crowded and blah.",2
835,"A word of warning: I believe many of the rave reviews Fisherman's Cove is receiving are actually for Harbor Seafood, which is the restaurant next door- as Fisherman's Cove is not a dine-in restaurant. Many of the photo's posted under Fisherman's Cove feature blue tables, and I know for a fact that those tables belong to Harbor Seafood {see my review/photos for Harbor as further proof! 

As far as Fisherman's Cove goes, I am seriously disappointed. If you're looking for good boiled shrimp and crawfish to go, I would recommend trying anywhere else! I love spicy seafood, but this was ridiculous and actually kind of miserable.

My fiance purchased $50 worth of boiled shrimp and crawfish for dinner and both tasted of nothing but pepper! It obvious the crawfish were not soaked properly - the heads were dry, no juice at all! -and coated in pepper, as were the shrimp. The only thing we could taste was salt and spice, there was no real flavor present! Missing the basics - onion, garlic, lemon and a 20 minute soak minimum. 

We couldn't even finish our dinner. What a waste!",1
836,"If you want to eat at Prep & Pastry on the weekends, go right when it opens or before it closes. There is always a long wait because of how busy it gets - but the wait is always worth it. The food there is absolutely amazing. I go there often and love the green eggs & ham, bloody marys, and mimosas! They gave me a free pastry on my birthday once, it was delicious! I wish I remembered what it was called. 

I also love that they serve EXO coffee here (a local coffee) - nothing better than a great breakfast with great coffee to go with it!",5
837,Our initial contact with the waiter was disappointing as he did not smile and was quite unfriendly. We were the only table in the restaurant and our single appetizer took 20 minutes followed by a 4 0minute wait for our lunch. The 1/4 chicken had no flavor and the rice was bland. Cute place but with numerous great restaurants in Nashville I will not return to any of them if first impression is an epic fail.,1
838,"Bailey's range yet another great product from Mr. Bailey. 

The choice of burgers is great whether you want beef, bison, or chicken.  The beer selection is great loaded with alot of local craft beers. The homemade dipping sauce are all unique and awesome.

This restaurant is great for kids....I repeat great for kids....",4
839,"Christine is a great restaurateur. Nice vibe, drinks, food, and tunes. You may remember her venture Aubergine that she founded with Gil (now at LuLu's). Her menu has evolved. So have the drinks. Don't try to move the couches they will fall apart.",4
840,"This is, without question, the best car wash around. They are insanely thorough when cleaning the car, and the place is always packed. Due to both, be prepared to be there on average 20-30 minutes. But it's well worth it! 
Also, looks like they are now offering coupons online, so be sure to check them out.",5
841,"If you want a half ass car wash, go here. I'm very disappointed on how my car looked. I went home to re clean what they missed. I called the store to see what they could do for me and he states the manager only handles complaints face to face and that I can drive all the way back to re do my car. If this place had good customer service, he would of offered me a discount or a free car wash. I unfortunately will not be coming here again.",2
842,"Yelp led us astray this time. Not even close to 4 stars. We went for dinner - alligator bites, crab claws, panko-breaded redfish, crawfish etoufee. The redfish was delicious, but the crab claws and crawfish were few and far between and cooked almost into oblivion. A $12 martini was little more than fruit juice. The restaurant itself was sadly worn and less than clean - just go somewhere else.",2
843,"I've been here a few times now, each time I'm in town I try to stop here. The food is good and verbally the device is good as well. However, tonight's visit in was a bit confusing...

I entered the restaurant around 5:45pm, and upon entering there were three people seated inside, a couple in the back corner eating and a lady at the bar eating. Standing there for about 30 seconds or so, unsure if I should wait to be seated or seat myself, a woman in the back of the restaurant started yelling something towards the front of the place. I thought I did something wrong. 

She yelled something again and the guy in the corner turned and looked at me and went back to eating, once more she yelled and then he finally got up confused looking and started walking to the woman at the bar... and again the lady in the back yelled, he finally seems to notice me, and as he looked at me, confused, he said ""oh?"". At this point I looked at him and said: ""Just one please"". He still seemed confused as to why he was helpin me but told me to just sit anywhere. He followed me to the table and gave me a menu. Then immediately walked away.

A minute or two later he came back to get my drink order, to which I ordered water. When he returned with the drink he sat the water down with the woman at the bar, she said ""this isn't for me, I think that's his drink."" Pointing at me...

He then smiled and was like ""oh yeah."" Picking the drink back up and bringing it to me. He then just stood there, not saying anything - I took this as my queue to order so I pointed to what I wanted and said that I also wants to add an egg roll. Fairly quickly the food came out. Thankfully he not only brought the food to me but he also brought me the right food, with one exception - no egg roll. But after quickly setting it food down he darted outside for about 10'minutes - I believe he was trying to bring in customers who were walking by as he finally returned inside with a small group of people. 

At this point he takes care of their order then brings me a check. $30 with a soda, beer, and two meals on it, and again goes right back outside before I can even pick the ticket up to look over it. Not in a rush I waited a bit, sipped my water. He returned 6-8 minutes later and comes to collect the check. I tell him it's the wrong check.

He smiles and apologizes and comes back with another check. This time it had the correct meal but also had a $2.50 charger for a soft drink, to which I pointed down at my cup of water and told him that I only had a water and that there was a soda charge on the bill. He grabs it back and looks at it for a few seconds and then says he will be right back. 

At this point he finally brings the right check, my card was still in my hand but he darted off again before I could hand it back to him. So  walked up to the bar, near the register and stood there for about 5 minutes before someone would ring it out. At this point there were two tables with 5 total people and the woman at the bar, not a crazy rush by any standards. 

Paid and left... I will definitely think twice about returning, sadly.",2
844,"Fun, low key place to hang out in old city. They have a decent sized bar downstairs, with a separate dining area that has a lot of tables. There is a small bar and weird mosh-pit esque dancefloor upstairs, but that bar is cash only. Great selection of draft beers. The biggest drawback is that if all the seats at the bar are full, there's not really much room to stand unless you sit in the dining area, but that definitely has a different vibe. I heard the food is really good do I will probably be back to check that out.",3
845,"I have to admit, I'm kind of over Starr restaurants.  They were cool 5 years ago, but they seem to be a dime a dozen anymore.  That said, I still do love Jones, after all of these years.  The service is generally pretty good.  I still love the decor, feeling like I'm stepping into the Brady Bunches living room.  The food is great when you want comfort food.  

On the downside, it's always crowded, even during lunch hour.   But I guess the upside is the food and the fact that the people that work there aren't full of themselves, the way that most other servers are in his restaurants.",4
846,"Went in to Johnny Rockets at the Grand Sierra Resort for dinner and sat at the counter. I tried the chili bowl for the first time. Always looking for a great, home style chili, and found it here. The BEST restaurant chili I've ever tasted, and I'd order it again. Plus, the service by Alexandra was also 5-star. P.S. Don't pass up the chocolate shake!!",5
847,"Came here for breakfast for the first time a year ago.  Went here again last week.  Still very good!   Food is delicious, and the coffee (capuccinos, lattes, etc.) are outstanding.  Not too hot, not too bitter, and the milk is incorporated into the coffee just right.   Will definitely come back the next time we visit Santa Barbara.",5
848,"What a perfect way and meal to end our trip. 

One of several restaurants owned by Chef John Besh In New Orleans.  From appetizer to entrees all the way to the end, dessert. 

For our appetizer we split the Crab Meat Maison, served with fresh herbs, touch of horseradish and country bread croutons. 

My choice of entree was the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp over Roasted Jalapeño Cheese Grits and Andouille/green onion sausage.  I have never been a fan of grits before.  They have always been kind of bland, this one knocked my socks off. 

The wife went with the Fresh Gulf Fish done Amandine Style.  It was lightly battered with buttermilk and flour, then fried and topped with Almonds in a brown butter sauce.  Served with new potatoes, green beans and roasted vegetables. 

Please, try to save room for dessert.  Somehow we did. With two Cappuccinos we ordered Brendan's Bread Pudding. This is to die for! It is topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and is accompanied by a buttered pecan sauce.  Also ordered the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Tart, made with bittersweet chocolate and topped with Coconut Sorbet. 

Put this place on your bucket list of restaurants in NOLA. You won't be disappointed.",5
849,"Dirty, smelly, death trap.  I have complained to the front desk about the conditions of the men's locker and showers but nothing has gotten better. The garbage cans are over flowing and there's trash everywhere. IT STINKS TOO!!  I can never feel clean taking a shower there to go straight to work from the gym so I gave up trying to work out in the morning. The spin room is a death trap with all of the electric extensions they have to use for the fans to keep the spin room cool.  I can't wait for my membership to expire in the next few months.",1
850,"Went to Kings Garden for my birthday dinner, let me say that I don't think I will ever go back there again.  When we first walked in I noticed only one family eating in the restaurant. Anyway we decided to order seafood delight with brown rice, vegetable lo mien and a half peking duck with sticky buns.  First of all seafood delight was served on a sizzling skillet which cooled down quickly. Also, it was served with a small portion of brown rice. Maybe its my fault I should have known it was an individual portion and not served family style.  The lo mien was Ok but again it was a small portion.  All of this would have been OK but the peking duck was the worst. I was really looking forward to the sticky buns and to my surprise when the duck came out it was served with cold flour tortillas! When we finished my Mom was still hungry and wanted to order more food (we are not really big eaters).  One saying grace were the fortune cookies that we enjoyed with our hot tea.  When we left the only people eating in the restaurant was the family that owns the restaurant.  I should have gone with my Mom first instinct to have fish and chips for my birthday dinner at McMenamins.",1
851,"Don't shop here very often due to it's distance from home. They do have many items that you just can't find elsewhere. They have a fantastic bakery and prepared foods operation. Prices can be a bit higher than the competition. For example, a filled king cake was priced $18, while the same flavor was $8 at Winn Dixie.",4
852,"Horrible!!  Bad service, messy operation and gave away my $300 Pliners!  What kind of business operates by giving away expensive shoes instead of repairing them?  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!",1
853,"It's close to my office so I find myself here fairly often. The fact that you can order online and then pick up in-store is appealing.  Sometimes I just don't want to deal with people, you know? 

The best way I can describe La Madeleine's to people not from around here is that it's like Panera, but French-ier. So instead of soup you get soupe and instead of salad you order a salade. Lots of extra E's on things.  Calorie and nutritional information is available for just about everything. 

There are lunch specials which are reasonable and plenty of vegetarian options as well. Fresh baked breads and pastries (think tarts and cakes and cookies) and even a small wine selection. 

If you dine in, be sure to leave a buck or two at the table for the guy clearing away your dirty dishes.",3
854,"All I needed was a written estimate.  A rather simple task one would think.  I needed my factory navigation unit in my Denali replaced, and needed to know costs and in writing.  Now this is a normal standard procedure for an auto repair shop.  Let's just assume its bad (it is), so tell me how much it is to remove bad part, and put the new one in.

Jay Fatimo or something like that, said he was very busy, as were the other service writers, so he handed me his card, and said to just email him with what I needed.  Sounded like a good plan, I wasn't in a big rush.  So I did just that, sent a picture of my vin, and the appropriate RPO codes to know what part I needed, and emailed it all to him.  I never got a response.  I tried again about a week or so later, still nothing.  Made sure it is his email at the dealership, etc.  

I guess I have a hard time with taking my car in or trusting a place to do such repairs (3000 dollar job according to Winkel GMC) if they can't even respond to an email.  He knew I would email that day, and I did.  

I guess the GMC dealer right next door gets my money instead.",1
855,"I work at the Frist and I don't eat at the cafe much, since I like to leave the building and go home for lunch. But once in a blue moon on a really dreary day like today, I stay in and have the Cobb Salad. It's a go-to for gluten free noshers like me. Add an extra egg for extra protein punch (as if all the meat wasn't enough already) and oil and vinegar dressing and i'm doing ok. A lot of museum visitors and local employees come for the cheap prices and quick bites. Beware of Senior Mondays (every 3rd Monday of the month) and weekends at lunchtime- it's usually busiest at 1130-noon.",3
856,"A little on the pricy side, but I guess considering the location. . . Also, the ambiance was nice, and the restaurant had a nice, cozy feel.

The service was really good, and the steak was delicious. We go the burger, which was good and a steak with brussel sprouts and mushrooms as the sides. Neither one of the sides were standouts, and we were saddened when we saw our neighboring table get the mac and cheese, which looked yummy.

We went there because we had a groupon, but will probably not be back.",3
857,This was my first time at Our Daily Bread and I loved it! I ordered the lemon-blueberry hotcakes and was very pleased. I loved the hint of the lemon because it wasn't too overwhelming and the maple syrup was really good too! I also ordered the hot chocolate and it was delicious. I am very picky about my hot chocolate and it was just right! My only confusion was where to put my dishes once I was done but I asked an employee and he was very kind and told me to leave them on the table. Go try it everyone!,4
858,"We came here for brunch after finding out that Sabrina's opened one up here in NJ. While driving to the restaurant, we checked in through the Nowait app. The app wasn't coordinating with the restaurant because it said that there were 6 people ahead of us when there weren't any. But, we were glad that we used it because there was a fair going on right outside the restaurant. Daughter ordered the Tofu Scramble and thought it was pretty good. Hubs ordered the Be Nice To Your Brother Egg White Special and thought it was okay and it was no big deal. I ordered the Stuffed Challah French Toast and thought it was good. My order was huge and I had to get a box to bring that home. The only complaint I had about the place was the waitress. She was never around and we had to wait a while to get our check. Glad we got to try here, though!",3
859,"This in my go to sushi place in center city. The food is always fresh and tastes good. My go to is the Kano crunch house special roll. It comes covered in spicy mayo and crunchy caviar on top. I recently discovered the ak-47 roll which comes with shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, and a special soy paper on the outside. It's very good as well. For appetizer I love the rock shrimp which is covered in a sauce similar to spicy mayo and drizzled in soy sauce, it is crunchy and amazing. The California roll I would say is pretty standard compared to other places. They also offer a lunch special on weekdays!",4
860,Sam's brick oven pizza has a great atmosphere and delicious food. I really like how I can see their brick oven pizzas cooked in front of me. All of their pizzas are good (I've tried many of them) but my favorite is the prime rib one. Their specials are always diverse and delicious as well. Great drink selection and karaoke and trivia nights are fun too!,5
861,"The cuisine at Honey's is a mix of Southern and Jewish favorites. I was overwhelmed with all the delicious sides offered at Honey's. You can get grits or an onion potato latke(fried crispy to perfection). They have fresh mixes on traditional breakfast food like omelets with asparagus. The pancakes can be ordered with several different kinds of fruit inside the pancake. I was also thrilled to be able order buttered challah bread with my meal. 
The restaurant was decorated in a rustic, colonial theme, but it wasn't over the top or too stuffy. Honey's has a very young feeling. Situated in Northern Liberties, Honey's is delicious, hip, and not far from the neighborhood strip.",4
862,"The meal was very good. Had black pasta with seafood, gnocchi, and pizza. Creative, served at perfect temperature, service ruined an otherwise perfect meal. No matter the question about a dish or more water to waiter it was AWESOME. And 33rd time you hear that word to describe something, you realize it is a catch word rather than the truth. I was amazed an M Street restaurant doesn't train their staff on what to say about the food and how to answer a guest's question more descriptively. In other words anytime now my guests and I hear the word we laugh! It is a word we use to mean exaggeration.",3
863,"Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good.",1
864,"I have been going to gyms ever since I got out of college this is by far my favorite one.

I use it for some lifting, a place to do plyometrics and a training center to get ready for my races as running is my real passion. 

First up it is cheap. $29 bucks a month + the initiation and the random $50 fee they charge in October "" to keep your monthly rate down"" is not bad at all for the city.

The mornings are dead and I love it, I am there 3 or 4 days a week M-F and out by 9:30am.

The place is clean, i shower a lot here b4 work and I have yet to find something worse then what I would find in my own home...and I am a bit of a clean freak.

Members are cool, no huge gangs of weightlifters  taking over a bench for 2 hours and screaming with each set. Very diverse group of people....from yoga people to the MMA dudes to the spin people.

Employees are cool, usually helpful and at least say hey. Would like it a bit better if somebody was always at the smoothie stand so i did not need to hunt somebody down every time i wanted something.

All and all my experience the last few months has been good. I recommend at least giving it a weeks try...the sales guys are not pushy and chances are you will find a gym you like.",4
865,"yeah, i know, you never knew this place had a name, well it does and you best learn it! this is basically a satellite of taqueria veracruzana to me, for what is awesome mexican food without a nice cold beer? just awesome mexican food.
 my circle of friends call this place ""the grime"" or "" the beer garden"" or ""the hockey arena"", you'll have to actually go to figure the last one out. they do have , i believe, the cheapest six pack of yuengling lager in the hood and some of the drunkest mexicans you'll ever see. this place has served me well for the last few years, just dont take your girlfriend along unless you like fighting.
the owners name is sonny, he's nice.",3
866,Parking is a hassle as the garage does not take credit cards.  The walls are paper thin so I could hear everything two rooms away from me. I was up all night and was exhausted for my conference the next day!  The doors slam shut which I don't understand why they don't adjust them.  What an awful experience. I will never stay here again nor recommend it to anyone else.,1
867,"Great grocery for for everyday items! 
Usually no wait for check out! 
Fast counter should be more ready for items out of stock or need more prep time. I have waited more than most would for items that need to be made due to being sold out.
Clean & friendly staff! 

Left Publix for this 1 location on grocery store. 

Now has a Tesla charging station.",4
868,Best thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again.,5
869,"Ruchi Indian Cuisine is a pretty sweet place to stop buy and have a meal. You can either stop by for some lunch or if you are the type of person who has dinner, you can have dinner there as well.

Ruchi Indian Cuisine surprised me in how good their food is. I really do not know a whole lot about Indian food so I kind of did not know what to expect when walking in. After the last Indian restaurant I went to I had some reservations about eating it again. Maybe it was the place I was at or the total lack of food that came out on my plate, but the last place wounded me. This place however, the Ruchi Indian Cuisine made up for any wrong doing that other place had done to me.

The food was wonderful and you got plenty of it. Not some much that with one plate you could stop hunger in Africa, but enough that will fill you up and you won't have a whole lot left over. The service is also great.

Ruchi Indian Cuisine is a great Indian restaurant.",4
870,"What an amazing find this little place is. 
We had time before our Busch tour and since Sage is right across the street, we decided to try it. I can say again how glad I am that we did.
There were 3 of us and we each decided on something different. One got the Asian wrap and made 'yum' noises the entire time we ate. I opted for the Fried Tilapia Reuben - a strange idea if I ever heard one. It was so good that I havent stopped talking about it since I got back. Something about the richness of the batter with the fattiness of the oil made it so reminiscent of Rubens that it was amazing (of course, I havent had a real Ruben since I started keeping kosher some 30+ years ago, so that might have something to do with it as well)
The sweet potato fires that accompanied each of our dishes was also a standout. While they have become almost ubiquitous, these seemed to be made from scratch and not just purchased frozen bagful at a time.
I'd go back in a St Louis minute",5
871,"Was not what I expected. No Asian ambiance, in fact not one Asian person working here. Felt more like a western bar.

Gave it a try and it wasn't horrible. However, my teen daughter ordered the fried rice and to her dismay, it was spicy! It did not indicate that on the menu and no one bothered to warn us. Spicy is not a standard expectation for Japanese fried rice! :( 

My other daughter and I had the park belly ramen. Broth wasn't bad, but very salty. Noodles were so-so. Pork belly and egg were the best part, cooked deliciously!

I rate this place low because the pricing is ridiculously high for ramen ($14) Also, we omitted the duck from the fried rice and they still charged us full price!. :(",1
872,"Solid Lee's. The employees are courteous, and the food comes out fast and hot. The bathroom was also relatively clean. Foodwise, the coleslaw was great. I also tried the spicy dippers but couldn't tell if they were spicy or not.",4
873,"Our first time is our last time.  Worst margaritas we've had anywhere.  What Mexican restaurant can't make a good margarita??  Each of our meals was boring and unauthentic.  My burrito came wrapped in a piece of foil served on a plate (felt like I had hit a drive thru).   No sides...just one chicken burrito for $9.99.   When we tried to use our $3 off $15 coupon we were told we couldn't use it.  Really?  After spending almost $50 on three regular margaritas and two entrees (no appetizers and no desserts and yes it cost that much).   Extremely overpriced, poor service, boring food.",1

875,"Terrible Service! I went there with a co worker around 5pm to get drinks using a giftcard I got from RiteAid.com. I've been there a couple times because their chicken fingers are delicious! When I got there, I told the bartender that I had 2 /$10 coupons(only because it didnt allow me to buy $20), she said I could only use one coupon per month. So I said 'okay well then we'll just be getting some drinks.' 
She never said anyrhing else. So when we get the bill, the owner came over and told me to never come back!! All because we didnt order food and he thought I was scamming him!! (If she said we had to buy food then we would have) Then said shouted that doesn't support alcoholism! (But owns a bar) I can't believe because I had 3 beers after work on a Monday, I'm considered an alcoholic! The bill was about $18 and I was going to give a good tip but.... I'm never going back. Just like another review I saw for this place- ""These people judge a book by its cover."" If you don't want people to use the coupons!! don't offer to be on the website!!. It's simple. Such bad business!",1

Recently, I needed a quick color appt. for an event.  Nicole was on vacation so I ended up with Amanda. My hair looked nice, but two hours later bloody scabs started popping up all over my scalp. The back of my ears and hairline were on fire.  I waited a few days and then called the salon.  I left a message for Nicole for suggestions. Five days later, she hasn't called me back.  I paid $180 for this misery.  Two weeks later I'm still itching like crazy.  Calling the dermatologist Monday.  I will never go back to this salon.",1
879,This place is incredibly pricey $14 for a Moscow Mule? Especially one that was very week just tastes like ginger beer it was not enjoyable at all. Our bartender was nice but he kept touching his hair and then proceeded to grab ice with his bare hands and put that in customers glasses (really!) total disappointment especially because we love this hotel!!!,2
880,This is a great fresh fish market/lobster shack! If you want fancy this isn't the place for you! Styrofoam plates and lots of lobster! Jessica rocked at customer service! I shot a claw across the restaurant (NEWB) and she brought a new claw! Try the crab cakes and bread pudding.,5
881,"On the Run is a convenience store chain and BP gas station. It is in a very convenient location for those who are returning rental cars at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport! How many times have you been on the way back into an airport, and not found a gas station nearby? Happens to me to any times - often you have to go out of your way to find one. Not so here!

Paid at the pump - I note that the pump had a hand scrawled note taped to the pumps - requesting you press the appropriate button (credit or debit) before swiping your credit card. Never seen this before - this is the exact opposite procedure of other gas station pumps when using a credit card!

882,"I love this place! Freshest food is always worth the money! I'm a huge fan of the Fa La La La La-roasted turkey, house made cranberry sauce, baby swiss, lettuce and tarragon mayo, and I get mine on the pretzel ciabatta. Mmmm! Salads are always heaped with tons of the good stuff-greens, avocado, eggs, fruit, nuts....whatever it's topped with, there's always more than enough (in a good way!) And the tea there is absolutely fantastic! Always cold and refreshing!  To wrap up your meal and satiate your sweet tooth-huge chocolate chip cookies! Sometimes it gets a little crowded in the dining area, but in the restaurant biz, I guess that's a good thing!  I only don't care for the awkwardness of sitting at the side tables near the windows; if someone is at the table next to you, it's like sitting on their lap...yikes! but that's the only complaint I have! Overall, love the atmosphere and the food is super!",5
883,"Let me be the first to say this place is no better than the crappy reviews for the previous Radisaon Hotel that occupied this spot. Service: slow, crappy. Bathrooms: I found it amusing they went to the trouble to decoratively fold the toilet paper like a flag at Arlington, when they didn't even stock soap (had to go to front desk for that).
We thought Theresa sucked, then realized it's because they were sleep number beds that you could not inflate. Front desk lady didn't even understand that there was no apparatus to inflate it. When the maintenance guy came-with hands so dirty, looked like he just crawled out of a messy turbine- he had to handle the sheets to access the air plug with the one inflating machine. Evidently, he didn't get one of the mattresses plugged back up, because it slowly deflated over night. What an absolute crap hole. We had seen online that it was recently renovated- hahaha. Maybe they have just started, but, I don't think so. 
They need to replace the mattresses or get the adjusters for the sleep number back. Just to be at a base level. Never again for this gal!",1
884,"I came here for the World Cup finals, so I kind of figure that I had a different experience than normal.

That being said, I really enjoyed this spot. Having recently relocated to central Indiana, and I loved this bar. They had a great beer selection. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, and my waiter offered up options to meet my wants. He was so knowledgable and led me in the right direction! His name was Shawn, and he seemed like a beer master.

We also ordered the cheese and gravy chips. Cheese fries are NEVER a bad idea. They were amazing, and according to the menu, they're ""Doctor Recommended."" So, go for it!",4
885,"Best coffee I've had in chilly, hands down.  Never tasted a latte like this.  Food was fantastic as well, had the gurt with granola and berries, tasted fresh.  I don't know what their secret is but I must find out before I die, it really is the best.",5
886,"Finally an authentic Mexican taqueria! You know you're in the right place when it's packed with the locals. Hard to get a table on the weekends. Menu is small, prices are average, the tacos are packed with meat, but the star here are the handmade corn tortillas. Walking into this place I felt like I was back in Mexico visiting family. I would've given them 5 stars but one of the ladies there was rude when I asked for a fork. She said,""they're tacos. You don't eat them with a fork."" Well duh, but I use it to pick up all the meat that spills out of the taco. Whatever. Not a fancy place but food is good.",4
887,"If you love to torture yourself with massive amounts of screaming children, and trashy girls looking for revealing costumes then come to masquerade!!!

I guess it's okay if you're into that pre-packaged Halloween thing, but that kind of makes my skin crawl. After going to the amazing Pierre's, I wandered into this place because I wanted a cheap tube of white greasepaint. That's it. To my amazement they carried ben nye makeup as well-- all marked up about 3 -5 dollars more than the place I was previously at. Super lame. However they do carry woochie prosthetics which is really cool.  

After I found the greasepaint, I went to go over to the line... which went from the registers wrapped around an aisle, and snaked to the back of the store. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. Luckily, it only took me about 5 - 10 minutes to get to the front. I promptly checked out, and went outside only to notice there was now a line to get INTO the store. It went down the building towards the awesome bagel place.

All I know for sure is the day after halloween, they better discount the shit out of their inventory so I can go crazy with cheesy home decorations. Everyone needs a bleeding candle year round, don't they?",3
888,"Some background.  I have lived in Chicago and my parents still live there.  When I go back to Chicago I try to eat at either Giordano's or Lou Malnati's.  I like them both.   Last night, a group of 6 dined at 312.  We were seated pretty quick for a Saturday night which was great.  Our server was attentive and patient as we were trying to figure out what we wanted.  A great atmosphere and location in Germantown.  

We started with the cheese curds and breaded mushroom appetizers, they were good, but I thought they had too much breading though I would still recommend. The sauce served with each was very tasty. 

We ordered two deep dish pizzas - the Capone and the Deerborn Station.  The pizza was pretty good.   Everyone at the table liked it, but we're not blown away.  I did like the ingredients and the sauce was good.  I think the issue was the crust - it was was pretty hard and overly crispy.  I had a hard time cutting it with a knife. Probably burned as the top of the Capone was a little black.  

Perhaps my expectations were too high.  I will try again.",3

890,I am a branch manager and I booked this hotel through my job. I checked in on May 19th 2017 and was given room 228. I went to bed that night and woke up with 3 bites on my back overtop of my buttocks. I am from Virginia Beach in the process of relocating to Tampa as my husband is retiring from the marines so I thought it was just a bug that had bit me outside. I went to bed the next night and woke up and there were a total of about 25 bites on my lower back above my buttocks. I pulled the covers back and looked at the mattresses that were covered with mattress covers and I saw nothing. Then I pulled back the bed skirt which smelled terrible and there were bed bugs crawling around. I immediately went to the front desk took the clerk in the womens bathroom and showed her all the bites. Initially she tried to state that they did not look like bites to her then I showed her the pictures I took and we went upstairs and I pulled the bed skirt and showed her and her maintenance man. They moved me to another room and offered to refund my money. I could not sleep I was waking up every few minutes looking at the sheets my back was having sharp pains and had swollen up. I went down stairs and was told they were only reimbursing my room even though I had paid for 2 rooms. I explained to them that they were responsible and that I was unable to drive and that I needed my clothes clean as I did not want to take anything home. We stayed 4 nights they reimbursed the nights purchased one night of dinner and gave me 4 dollars in quarters to wash my clothes myself in pain. They apologized I had to request a incedent report ad they did not create one and I was offered nothing else. I have to go back by myself this Friday which I am going to fly as my back is still swollen. I am scared to stay anywhere but we are relocating so I have no choice. The manager Henry and the assistant GM Nola was nice but I dont feel like they did enough and I am headed to the doctor this morning as I have had a allergic reaction to the bites and it has not cleared up and I had to drive 12 hours back in pain from one visit,1
891,Two weekends in a row with poor car selection for emerald executive elite and the shuttle to and from the airport has been ridiculous for Friday night pickups and Sunday afternoon drop offs.

892,"Katie's is a must for those seeking New Orleans contemporary classics.

The poboy list was astounding, and great contemporary takes on such things as 'Oysters Rockefeller'.

The chicken andouille sausage gumbo was fair. I've had better at various other establishments. A lack of rice, a lack of ""trinity"" (seasoning) and sparse nuggets of andouille and chicken were certainly a disappointment. The roux was the perfect darkness, but it lacked body and substance. I wouldn't have it again, and I don't recommend anyone try it, especially if you have had a good gumbo. It will fail to please.

The red beans and sausage were awesome. Creamy, with a great mouth-feel, superbly seasoned, the red beans may be the best I've had -- and I've been frequenting New Orleans restaurants for over three decades. The sausage was a great example of a good smoked sausage with a hint of piquant, crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside. Now, the rice... why is it something so simple could ruin an otherwise perfect meal? First, red beans (unless you're serving soup) is traditionally served with rice. Rice should be fluffy, warm, and moist. This was obviously left in a steam pan with no lid. It was dry, hard, brittle, and inedible. Why even serve the stuff? Rice is cheap, make another batch, don't serve something you wouldn't stand behind!

The service was absolutely terrible. I had to wait to get a drink order (7 minutes, I timed it). I had to wait to get my drink (8 minutes, timed again). My food order was taken by another waiter who saw I had not been served, and by the look on his face, felt sorry for me. My waiter did not check on my food service until after I had finished my meal -- fortunately, the owner did check on me. I even had to wait to pay my bill -- which to me, if someone is looking to pay and leave, and you're in the business to generate revenue -- it's important to make sure they have the bill and make a timely payment.

After all the negative reviews, why would I give Katie's such a high rating? Well, I will tell you. A) The Food. B) the atmosphere C) I'm not going to let a worthless server ruin a good establishment D) the owner took an interest in my experience.

Try Katie's for yourself. If you have as bad of a serving experience as I had, inform the owner. I did not, and I regret it.",4
893,"I went in for a manicure and I will not be coming back. I walked in and immediately wanted to leave. It was so uncomfortably hot and stuffy. As I was choosing the color the girl came up to me and asked if I was ready. Less than a minute later she comes up to me again and asks if I'm ready. So rude. 
When I did sit down for the manicure, she did not take good care of me. She barely used the nippers on my cuticles or skin and filed my nails crooked. Then she left half way through my manicure to do three eyebrow waxings. As if this weren't bad enough, she got polish on my fingers and missed a sizable amount on my pinkies.
I will not be returning to this establishment and I hope you will not either. Go to LyLy's across the highway. Better customer service and quality manicure!",1
894,"I had to mix my own drink. Let that sink in for a second....I. Had. To. Mix. My. Own. Drink. 

I checked out the menu in the lobby while I waited for friends. Saw that a regular frozen margarita was $6.75 and a flavored one was $8.50. Confirmed here on their website: http://neworleans.superiorgrill.com/drink-menu.html

When I asked the bartender what flavors of frozen margaritas they had, he rattled off a list: watermelon, peach, blackberry, and some others. I said I would like a blackberry frozen margarita.

The bartender served me a regular frozen margarita with a small glass of blackberry syrup on the side. ""That'll be $11.75,"" he said. I said ""I thought flavored margaritas were $8.50?"" He said ""That's only for strawberry."" 

I said, ""Why are you giving it to me like this? It's not mixed."" He replied ""So you can see what you are paying for.""

I proceeded to pour the blackberry syrup into my tall margarita cup. It pooled on top of the drink and would not thoroughly blend with the rest of the drink. I asked the bartender if I could have a cup so I could mix the drink by pouring it back and forth between cups. Instead of offering to mix the drink himself, or providing me a spoon instead of a flimsy straw to mix my drink, he handed me a styrofoam cup.

There were two male customers on either side of me, they were audibly sympathizing with me and making comments about having to mix my own drink.

In retrospect, I should have asked to see the menu so I could point out that it said Flavored Margaritas were $8.50, and didn't say ""Strawberry only."" But at a crowded bar with people waiting behind me to be served, I didn't want to cause a scene.

Instead, I will vote with my feet and my wallet, and avoid Superior Grill and their lazy, apathetic, misinformed bartenders.",1
895,"I think my wife and I will be returning here again. We had always passed by aloft and had wanted to try it out. 

It's very modern and hip looking so it was always alluring. We finally had the time and found a deal on hotels.com and decided to do it. We got a king-size bed standard loft. 

The hotel is very clean, is styled to TW max with modern lighting and seating in the lobby. The bar is very cool and I could see myself sitting down there all night with my wife if we had the time. The food area has an assortment of muffins, fruit, an packaged food. None is free but prices aren't terrible. There is a make it yourself cappuccino machine. 

The pool and fitness area are open 24 hours which is awesome. There is also an outside seating area which is very cool. Another plus for pet owners is that dogs under 40 pounds stay free. 

The rooms are much like the rest of the hotel - modern and clean while remaining well thought-out. They walk in shower an spa-quality soaps and lotions were fun. 

Minus one star for the service unfortunately. I think others alluded to it as well - the staff is a bit too casual for my liking - I like that they are also trendy, but this is a hotel, not a coffee shop. I also didn't have an iron in my room and upon requesting one, had it delivered by someone who I think may have not been an actual employee but a friend of an employee. I know, it's odd - but I could be wrong. 

Overall, this place is very cool. Give it a shot, especially if you are on a layover or find a great deal.",4
896,"Let me preface by saying, I generally dislike chain restaurants. I stopped in last Friday for lunch with two coworkers at this specific location. It was busy, most of the tables were full. We stood by the drink station waiting for a seat, not because every table was taken but because several had not been bussed. 

After about 3 minutes, I asked the one dining room server if he could please buss a table for us. After about two more minutes of waiting (as he scurried to get orders to tables), I walked to the counter, grabbed the towel and bussed the table myself so we could sit. 

My Pei Wei Spicy chicken salad was ok. The chicken was cooked perfectly (the only reason I gave 2 stars) but the salad was over dressed. I ate the chicken but only a little bit of the actual salad. 

First: Seriously, only one dining room server/busy boy for a Cool Springs restaurant during lunch rush hour? Insane!

Second: Should I even consider going here again, dressing on the side please. This has never been an issue for me since I usually ask for extra dressing.",2

901,"Jee Whizz! The steak and cheese was AWSOME. Now I must say this was my first. I do a lot of traveling and hear about how awesome an authentic Philly cheese steak sandwich is. When I asked some locals about where to get a good cheese steak they mentioned a couple of places, when one of the individuals said its all about the cheese and meat you need to go to Armadore pizza. 

Once I sank my teeth into it,  I must say the flavor was superb. The aroma emitting from the sack while driving back to hotel was mind blowing & mouth watering. Even in the elevator up to my room, people were commenting how good it smelled. Asking where did I get it from. 

The staff was super, very helpful. As this was my first cheese steak. the guy taking the order asks what do you want on it. Like I would know after all this was my first. He asked you like onion etc. Anyway he was polite helpful and sandwich was AWSOME, 

The fries were tasty. I was instructed to request the extra crispy fries. again this was new to me.  i guess i will now order my fries extra crispy. There were  a chit load of them in the bag.",5

The beer is pretty good.  I wish they would do some more adventurous offerings, but I can still get a good beer here.  
The food can be a mixed bag.  I had a small pizza that was a gooey mess (mushrooms and hearty toppings need a thick crust for stability).  I love all the scotch egg offerings (you can get it on a pizza or burger here), but they are so salty.  The burgers are good. The desserts are great (please get the frangipane).  It's also great to get the ploughman's plate and a beer, and just relax for a bit.",4
904,"If you are aimlessly staring at the menu, get the Ziggy Burger! I mean, how cool is that name? The sweet potato fries were yummy too. 

Space is limited but everyone is friendly and the overall atmosphere is nice.

My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that this is one of those places that carnivores tend to like more than actual vegetarians/vegans because they serve what I like to call ""sex with your pants on"" food. As in, lots of carbs and empty calories to make it agreeable to those who feel that healthy food is tasteless. If you are looking for clean and unprocessed ingredients and are turned off by a little grease...this may not be the spot for you. But if your only requirement is ""meatless"", or you want to try something new and different, this is definitely worth a try.

BUT...I think even the most health conscious palettes can appreciate the power of the Groothie. 

Love, peace, and veggies.",3
905,"Headed to Franklin TN for the day from our weekend in Nashville.  Read about this location on yelp and looking for a good hearty breakfast....great choice.  Busy busy place but, still the service was attentive and friendly.  Neat concept of a location....looks like a restaurant....or bar with stage....or a grocery store.  It's really cool!   Food was so flavorful, hot and just all over great.  Good portions and great options....menu items and a breakfast buffet....can't go wrong.

Defintely, would recommend!!",4
906,"We had dinner there on January 14th.  The Beet Salad was okay .....just okay. The portion was small for the price, and it looked as though it had been prepared earlier, perhaps wrapped in plastic wrap, and then unwrapped to be served...everything was sort of smashed together on the plate.  My friends steak was ordered Medium and served Med Rare and floating in butter. The fries were lukewarm. Service was pleasant and friendly and beverages were kept full.

Then we had breakfast on January 16th and 17th.  The staff were all smiling and friendly ....they seemed to want to help....but there also seemed to be a big gap in organization. On both mornings, the buffet ran out of plates and food. When the food was replenished, the portions put out were small ...even though the restaurant and the bar were packed with people. If you weren't standing at the buffet, waiting for more food to come out ....then by the time you got from your table to the buffet and waited in line ....the food was gone again.  On both mornings.....I ate my toast, scrambled eggs, and bacon at differing times because if there were eggs...there was no bacon, if there was bacon there were no eggs.....and the loaf of bread was over 30 minutes in appearing.  

There was also something else we encountered.  The tables had napkins, forks, and knifes .....but no spoons.  Coffee was offered to us on both mornings....and we asked for cream and Splenda ...which were quickly provided.  And when we said 'there are no spoons'....the waitress on each morning said 'yes, we don't roll them in the napkins anymore because people are stealing them'....so then we smiled and said ...'well can we have spoons please?' .... spoons never arrived, so we used our knives.  Now ....if you, as a waitress, know there are no spoons on the table, and you also know your customer wants cream and sweetener for their coffee.......wouldn't you bring a spoon when you deliver the cream?  

It was clean and the staff IS friendly ...they just need some good old fashioned direction.",2
907,"Had a falafel wrap here a few years ago. Not bad, so tried it again today. No flavor, except extreme saltiness! The falafels & pita = no flavor. I was hoping the tzatziki sauce would pull it all together, nope! It had no flavor either. It wasn't like the sauce you'd imagine, but more like a thin tasteless glue. Only good part about the wrap were the fresh diced cucumber & tomato, too bad that was underneath the icky white sauce that doesn't even deserve to be called tzatziki : (",2
908,"The cake was really great!  We picked up the carrot and chocolate cake slices. We liked that they were not sickly sweet. For the how busy the place was and small the entry felt we won't go out of our way to pick up more slices. If we are close we might stop by. For being the first time there half of the cakes did not have descriptions. We asked the girl ringing people up and she had to go ask someone else. Kinda weird when you work there we thought. 
It is the perfect place for anyone who loves pink!!!! Pink and glitter everywhere!!!!  Personally glitter is not my favorite thing.",2
909,"We arrived on a Monday night unannounced with a big group maybe.  We weren't sure how many people were going to make it because it was early for dinner (5:15) but we had a graduation at 7 so the time was set.  They moved tables in anticipation of people and everyone was smiles and helpful.  After everything we had 12 people show up.  I looked at the pictures on yelp before we chose this place and I thought big place but in reality this is not a very big place because we had at least 1/3 of the restaurant covered.  The wait staff was patient since everyone arrived at different times and the food came out as expected in waves.  The food.  It was Thai food and very tasty but I think they need convincing about how much heat an American can take.  I asked for hot and I got hot for my mother.  Next time I will spend more time explaining what my level of hot is and you should too.  The food was tasty and high quality.  It was a little different than Thai I have had in the past and I am not sure if that was because they were taming it down for me or if it is more true to the original.  I noticed a kitchen staff going outside and coming back with a large bunch of fresh mint.  Btw their parking lot is surrounded with with container gardens of mint, lemon grass, basil and a host of other fresh ingredients.  Tdlr good food decent prices nice service and the restaurant is an experience just to visit.",5
910,"I really wanted to like this place because I have work trips to Indy regularly and I stay right down the street from it.  

Am I too American?  The spices were just too much. I don't mean ""I couldn't handle it"" kind of way. I mean it in the ""the soup has too much salt"" kind of way.  

But let's be honest it is $8 lunch buffet, try it once.  Besides my tastebuds aren't your tastebuds.  So maybe you'll like it.  If you walk away feeling like me, then you're only out $8 + tip.",2
911,"We have been to the Philadelphia Ritz spa three times, all with less than glowing opinions.  If this spa were run by the Ritz, instead of a concession, it would be up to Ritz standards.  It is NOT.  How would you like your back rubbed by a hairy arm.
I have had men give services at many spas and have never experienced anything like The Ritz in Philadelphia.  It is a reftro fitted space because it was not built as a spa. They could have done a lot better.  Just returned from the Ritz Spa in Orlando. That is a Ritz run spa and wonderful.  I agree with another review that the people behind the front desk are anything but professional.
Amazingly, I met a woman from Philly in the steam room at the Ritz Orlando spa. She told me of her horrible experience at the Philadelphia Ritz Spa.  She left with her arm bleeding from too hard pressure.

912,"Yesterday, our breakfast experience was the low point of our stay in Montecito.

For the sake of the relationship. Well, Smith's doesn't disappoint. Rarely a problem finding a seat at the bar. Always with the drink specials during games. 

The food is usually very good. Above average bar food I would say. Love the boneless wings, love the pizzas, and even have been know to get adventurous on occasion with the fish tacos. I have been disappointed a few times but nothing consistent. Hit or miss specials during games.

Tons of TVs. Including the sneaky back room with the comfy chairs and dart board. I have watched a movie in this room, I hate to admit.",4

The question I have is has it always been ROACHES and INSECTS in their food and I just never seen it or is this the 1st time... Don't no and can't answer that only they no how clean they keep their kitchen......

Now some people who will eat anything will say go to this place but I would say stay away......

It was delicious ( granted my first and only time) I believe it's pork and has hominy, lettuce, radishes,onions and they give you a small container of dried oregano. Not the biggest fan of the lettuce cause it's gets all wilted but add some hot sauce and it's a meal in itself!!! I got also got the taco lunch special (2 pork tacos and rice) and that was good. Besides the amazing service from the sweet lady, the salsa was way sweet! Wasn't the biggest fan but everything is def fresh! And the pineapple water is a must. I don't like pineapples but I read reviews and just had to try it and thank u guys! Great reviews :) I'm excited to come back to try the burritos esp since I come out here for Costco shopping (soooo close by!) pretty dangerous when I find good food cause then I get cravings :/ enjoy this gem and eat up!!!",4

The food was poorly made thrown on a plate and served after another 20 minutes of waiting. I could have went to the gulf and caught my own fish to filet them myself quicker than they threw  this ""fast food"" together. Fish wasn't the same as the LJS in goodlettsville before it shut down.

They call this a ""sandwich"" but this is like a gigantic pita only it has a more bread like yet crispy texture. The spicy tzatziki sauce it comes with was so good I had to get more on the side!

925,"This Walmart is awful. Employees are rude and not helpful. Sketchy place. Nice greeters though so that's a plus. 

New incident happened on 08/15/17 
I hate to be negative but many things happened at this Walmart for me yesterday that baffled me. For one an older gentlemen was out in the heat pulling carts...I immediately thought that was strange but walked in and low and behold there were no carts for the customers. Meanwhile, there were a few younger employees doing nothing. A woman and I chatted about how wrong that was and then we see the older man pulling the carts to their designated area, no employee helped him so we both stepped up to help pull them in. I start shopping and once I'm done I go to checkout. I had three different coupons and I got to use two of them but the Tamera (the cash register lady and what her name tag said) said I couldn't use my $1 off Alka Seltzer coupon because what I got wasn't on the coupon....it states ANY Alka Seltzer product 12 count or more. I got the Alka Seltzer day time cold and flu 20 count. I tell her it should count and it doesn't matter if what I get isn't on the coupon if it says ""any alka Seltzer product"" and she begins to argue with me. So I naturally argue back. She calls for a manager so the manager can explain to me what she just said even though I told her it wasn't necessary. Well, as we're waiting she begins to say she remembers me from a few days ago. I say well I haven't shopped here in about two weeks. She says no you came in about a few days ago about the same thing. I said no I didn't, I haven't been here in two weeks. So once again she starts arguing with me over when I had been there... anyway I tell her it's taking too long for a manager to get here and all these people are probably getting mad about waiting and she says, ""it don't matter.""  the manager gets there. They're all buddy buddy so I already know I'm not getting the dollar off. I keep telling them it's not a big deal but they made it a big deal. The ""manager"" says yeah if the picture of what you're getting isn't on the coupon you can't get the dollar off. I say that makes no sense. She leaves. Tamera (the cash register) says it's company policy. My boyfriends dad is a manager for a Walmart. I talked to him and he said it's not company policy and the way this was handled was unacceptable. I said thank you to Tamera after it was all done and she just stared at me. So, I called 1800walmart and complained. Some changes need to be made at this Walmart before I ever step foot in it again. It was only a dollar yet the whole thing escalated into an argument that could have easily been avoided. Below is a picture of the coupon they wouldn't let me use. Notice how it says ""Any ONE Alka Seltzer product (12 count or larger).""",2

Girl ringing up my order seemed new, was running around attempting to make my coffee and asking the other barista (also at the counter) how to make the drinks we ordered AS HE CONTINUED TO MAKE HIS OWN DRINK AND TASTE TEST SYRUPS.  IT TOOK 15 minutes to make TWO DRINKS IN AN EMPTY SHOP.   The guy who sat there and stared at me as we waited never made one attempt to make my drink after I tipped 20% on the order.  Two coffees, $12.50 , 15 minute wait, empty shop.  Do the math.  This isn't the first time it has happened, staff is usually unfriendly.  I was coming in everyday and buying coffee but I got sick of spending my money with people who act like jerks.  I wrote an email to the shop and they never responded which is 100% proof they don't give a damn about bad service.  AS MUCH AS I LOVE COFFEE SHOPS I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE.",1
931,"We did not get a good experience from the start. The moment we walked in, the manager greeted us in a lackluster style. 

The buffet was okay, most of the food was lukewarm...which is never good for a restaurant. The only dishes that shined through were the Chicken tikka masala (delicious!) and the kheer (unusually good with a pinch of cinnamon!). The rest of the dishes were just okay. The rice tasted undercooked. And while we were eating, the manager started closing down the buffet...that is never good while customers are eating! It all felt really rushed :(

All in all, lukewarm food, lousy customer service and the manager was in a hurry.",2

933,"We absolutely loved this hotel,.  We didn't want to leave. The beach is across the street.  You can either: rent chairs from the town for, I think, $25/day, buy chairs from the nearby Walgreens or do what we did...borrow chairs from the front desk which were left behind by former guests.  The front desk will also give you beach towels.  

The hotel has a pool, but it's small, mostly in the shade and has both a view of the parking garage and the harbor.  However, you should really be taking advantage of the beautiful beach.

We had a corner room on the 9th floor with a great view of the beach.  It was quiet.  The rooms are big, modern, spotless, comfortable.  In addition, the bathrooms are luxurious.  The towels are placed neatly in a wooden shelving unit.  We've never seen such a thing before.  It was super cool.  They give you Bath and Body Works soap/shampoo/lotion/mouthwash.  There are extra power outlets, but they're in the desk lamp.  If you want to plug in your laptop or anything, you need to pull the lamp from the wall and spin it around.  Wifi is ok. 

Free continental breakfast each day: cereal, fruit, yogurt, danish, bagels, english muffins, biscuits/gravy, sausage patty, juice, coffee.

The staff was incredible.  They were so nice.  Front desk super helpful.  The housekeeper created towel animals which were placed on the bed each day.

Last, but not least, I have to mention the rooftop bar.  Jimmy's Crow's Nest and Iguana Bar is the ultimate place to see the sunset each day.  They have great food, great drinks and they give you a free shot.  Staff is great.

We will be back.",5
934,"Best buy is an excellent place to go if you need something fast or want to compare items on hand. Their staff are always eager to help and knowledgable.

936,"This place is hidden away by the slots and against the wall towards the other side of the casino downstairs.  I would've never known that there would be food court there but pretty convenient I suppose since you don't have to walk all the way to the middle of the casino and up the escalator and down to the other side towards Circus Circus to grab a quick bite.  This place had Asian food, Mexican food, American food and a deli.  I couldn't make up my mind what I wanted even though the menu was very limited for each section but I ended up getting some beef chowmein which was pretty good.  It's cooked to order, so they make it there right in front of you.  My mom always get the shrimp fried rice and in my opinion, I wouldn't get it because it was too plain? My cousin wanted to add noodles to her wonton soup but the cook said no? Which I don't understand why when there was a bunch of noodles there and we would've paid the extra charge.  The pad thai there is definitely not the one you get at your usual Thai restaurant either, they just threw a bunch of meat together and stir fry it with vegetables so don't expect that tamarind taste with the peanuts in there.  The noodle soup looked plain too, I think my cousins got the wonton, which doesnt come with noodle and one got the chicken and I didn't hear good things about.  Next time I come here, I would probably just stick with the deli items or the beef chowmein.  Oh they also serve breakfast here too.  The name says it all though, ""Fresh Express Food Court"", so expect a little below mediocre food!",3

Food: All I can say is DAAAMMMNNN. Hands down this is THE best burger & grilled cheese I have EVER had. My fiancee dragged the chef out the kitchen to praise him for the deliciousness we experienced. All imma say is whoever thought of brie cheese on a burger was simply brilliant! 

The staff was on point with service & made sure we were taken care of. Be warned though - do not expect your food to come out within minutes. The food here is made with love & care. It took us about 40mins to get our food for a table of two; but totally worth the wait. 

This will be a staple bar/restaurant to visit every time I visit this magical city!

939,"Ahh, my not so secret  love affair with cupcakes deepens with my experience at Jimmies Cupcake truck. Stopping at one? I would LOVE to see you try my darling. 

The day I came upon this truck I was all about some cupcakes and they had a pretty amazing variety. I was torn but not for long. I started at their James Bond (red velvet) cupcake and was immersed in a moist and creamy cupcake heaven. Just the right amount of sweetness for the frosting and the cupcakes were not too dense and not too light. It was perfection. I took out the cookies and cream cupcake next. The little Oreo cookies in the cupcake batter...genius. The frosting tasted JUST like Oreo filling and I was taken back to my childhood. I finished off with a menue special - apple cake cupcake. It was buttery, cinnomon-y (what?) and all the things that taste like Fall. Hallelujah! 

My only regret that day was that I could not eat any more.",3

I was a little shocked when they told me our order would be ready for pickup in 45 minutes, I'd expect that from a delivery but maybe they were busy when we called. Anyways, the small pizza is perfect sharing size (in my opinion) 3 slices each. The flavor and toppings were pretty good but I wasn't crazy about the crust. The garlic knots were ok, we felt like they were missing something or maybe a tad too much garlic but I'm not sure. Overall, it was a decent dinner and I'll prob give them another try in the future and update my review.",3
949,"Let me start off my saying that the deep dish pizza was excellent.  I loved the sauce.  We also had the fried blondies which were pretty good, but awfully rich.  I recommend calling ahead if you're going to have a deep dish pizza to cut down on wait time as it can take 45 mins to make.

The ONLY reason I'm giving 312 Pizza Co a 2 out of 5 stars is because of the racket that is going on across the street.  If you park in the Cumberland Machine Co. parking lot, you WILL get a boot and a $50 fine; however, their signage is TERRIBLE.  Myself and several others fell victim to this, and according to other Yelp reviewers, this has been going on a long time.  It's a shame that 312 isn't warning its patrons not to park there as I'm sure their fully aware of it.",2

I've gone back at least 10 times since. There was a long wait in drive through on one occasion due to a picky customer that kept changing her order at the window..the woman who served me was very apologetic .

It's close (which was its main draw) and Italian (who doesn't like Italian food?); yes, LaScala's seemed like the ""safe"" choice.  The decor is fine.  However, with the restaurant barely at capacity, we were originally sat at a wobbly table near the kitchen.  When we asked to move to another location, the hostess looked at me like I had suddenly sprouted some uncontrollable boil smack in the middle of my forehead, uttering, ""Uh, okay.""  Seated at our new table, I barely had 10 seconds to review the menu before we were prompted to order.  Folks, order...or you'll be waiting 10 - 15 minutes until the server comes back again.  We started with the caesar salad and calamari.  Both were decent in taste and portion size.  Our main courses came just as quickly, with one very big exception.  The server put in my entree as raviolis, not veal parmesan with angel hair.  I waited another 15 - 20 minutes for my food.  By the time my food arrived (sans angel hair, just regular spaghetti noodles), my fellow diners were more than half way through their food.  My entree did not blow me away by any means.  The sauce didn't take my breath away (good or bad) either.  On the plus side, the server was extremely apologetic and nice.

956,"Location: that is the reason I chose this hotel. However, after walking around the area many times I wish I had chosen one of the many other beautiful hotels in this area. 
Easy stuff first- The rooms: clean except the mattresses. Our mattress was highly stained and it was pretty sickening to look at. Didn't see any indication of bed bugs though so that's a plus. 
Bathroom came with plenty of lovely smelling soaps, body washes, hair supplies, and even a ""grooming kit."" 
The elevators are tricky, if you use the one to the far right it was super fast to arrive each time. If you tried to use any of the ones in the middle or right end, you'd wait for SO long. 
The location was great, easy to walk to Bourbon street and local restaurants, of course it's quite noisy at night from all the late-nighters who were a bit intoxicated, but that was to be expected considering we were so close to Bourbon street.  

The main reason I would not recommend this hotel is the sneaky attempts at selling vacation share/ownership. They give you incentives to attend a very nasty breakfast and lead you to believe it will be a total of an hour, well to spare the details it is well over 2 hours and caused us to miss morning plans in the city. They make you feel forced to stay and attend, If you refuse and decline the incentives then request your deposit back the staff turns incredibly rude. At which point you are forced to walk back to the hotel instead of taking the shuttle back (which is how you get to the ""VIP"" location).  It's something that reading fine print in the offer would save you the trouble of going through, but unfortunately they are good at talking and just saying ""initial here/sign here"" to get you locked in. Our stupidity to not read the fine print left us in this incredibly ridiculous outcome. 
When I stay at a nice hotel I want to be treated as a guest, not as a sales opportunity. It was worse than going to a car dealership and dealing with a car salesman. 
I would never stay at another Wyndham hotel.",2

We have to come back and try other food.",4
961,"I've been eating here since I was two years old! I learned how to use chopsticks here and I've seen the staff all grow up along with me. This place is by far the best Thai food I've ever had (and I've been to Simply Thai, Dusit Thai, Smiling Elephant and all those other places). 

For appetizers, the tiger tear salad, chicken satay, and tom yung koon are the bomb dot com and I never leave without having one of them.

They have the best pad thai and chicken panang, so be sure to try it sometime. The seafood curry, while pricey, is worth it for the large medley of seafood you get. Stay away from ordering native Thai hot unless you want a red ring in the morning! 

Please don't pass this hole in the wall up. You'll love every bite of whatever you decide to order. I've never had something I didn't like.",5
962,"Cold day some weeks ago...had heard great recommendations and went there to enjoy the food and scenery.  Very pretty spot

The order was pasta with clans and lobster tacos.  Both tasted good but nothing special. By he seating out door was a mess but we were hungry

An ok place.",3
963,"11 different protein options. Each are 3oz. Unlike other places that squash their patties flat and removes most of the juices, these are thicker and juicer with more flavor, they are just smaller in diameter. These are truly mini burgers with many fresh toppings. Sliders are typically 1oz or less. The sweet potato fries are awsome.",5
964,Great bagels but the egg sandwiches are not good. They use a liquid egg solution and cook it in the microwave. The eggs taste pretty synthetic,2
965,This is the best place we have ever ordered sushi from. We refer so many people to this restaurant because we know they are always consistent. The food is always fresh and delicious. The hibachi is also fantastic and fun. Way more than enough food. The scallops are phenomenal too. We have had a lot of different sushi rolls here and all of them are fantastic. You can't wrong. The fried rice is awesome. You can't go to this restaurant without eating the fried rice or you will miss out. Our meals range from $60 on up depending on what you order. The best suggestion I can make if you want to save money is to go during lunch. You can get the lunch box and it has a little bit of everything. The owner is awesome he remembers everyone that comes on. Every time we walk in he makes us feel so welcome and he even remembers if we don't have kids with us or not. I highly recommend this place!!! :),5
966,Why am I being forced to use a service I do not like.Express Scripts has not gotten my prescription  correct yet.It also costs more than my pharmacy. Their customer  service reps are not knowledgeable. I feel as though I am being held hostage.Where is my right to choose? I liked being able to speak to the people at my pharmacy. They were always  there to help.No stars from me.,1
967,"Long lines and slightly disorganized in the distribution component.  Food was good, but not the best available at the public market by far as it was rather bland.",3
968,"My wife and I have a tradition of spending our anniversary dinner at the Washington Crossing Inn which is where we were married 11 yrs ago.   This year was the worst year ever.  I called ahead to make reservations and specifically informed them of our anniversary and that every year we dine there as our tradition.   Usually we are offered free champagne and thanked for spending our time with them, but not this year.  Food was terrible and service was even worse. The summer corn salad was the best part of the entire meal.  The mixed grill was awful and not worth the 46 dollars.   The filet and lamb were tasteless and the ribs were a mushy mess of bones with very little meat. The delmonico steak was ok but again not worth the 42 dollars.  I would've loved another drink to try to forget this horrible experience, but the waitress never return after the dinner was served to see how everything was, and if we needed anything.  Overall it was an extremely disappointing experience, from the food to the service.  My wife left hungry, which is unfortunate for the money we spent.  Looks like we'll be looking for a new tradition next year.",2
969,Beer is ok at best. Over an hour wait for hamburger and they weren't even busy... bad service.,2
970,I popped in here with some coworkers for lunch the other day to see if all the buzz I've heard about the place was true. It's pretty small inside but we were able to grab the end of a joint table. We had to wait a good 10-15 minutes to place our order but the food came quickly. I shared the crudo pizza and a slice of the Pizza al taglio with one of my coworkers and it was AMAZING! The prosciutto melted in my mouth and the mixture of  mozzarella and parmigiano cheeses was divine. I think it's a bit pricey but totally worth it. I can't wait to return and try the Margherita pizza!,5
971,"A clean little place w average food. Friendly service, but this place does not deserve all the hype and 4-5 star ratings. Clean and simple, but nothing more. Don't walk more than a block for this.",2
972,"Remarkably decent and affordable, particularly for a chain restaurant, with friendly service and a welcoming atmosphere. A good place for everyday dining (if just slightly pricier than average) as well as larger parties. Basically, a good meal for a good price with good service.",4
973,"How I wish I could give Zeppoli five stars.  The food, hands down, is sublime.  The one word to describe the experience - fresh.  We ordered the Vongole, which could have been the best clams and macaroni I ever ate.  My swordfish was the best  - and every time I took I bite I uttered these words, ""Oh my God.  This is fabulous.""  My husband and I both agreed that Zeppoli was a treasure - for the food.

Unfortunately are two areas are in need of serious attention.  I understand from the reviews the noise level is an issue.  First thing I said to my husband when I sat down:  ""It is so noisy in here"".  This is a serious problem when you cannot hear the person next to you.  Cozy is one thing - incredibly loud that it took away from the experience is something else.  I think the later you make a reservation, the better it is. But, that did not help the service.

The other area for me that was a negative was the amount of time it took for us to eat.  It was a Thursday night and yes it was packed.  However, three hours for a dinner for two and waiting 30 minutes for bread and another 30 minutes once our dessert was finished and wine had been gone was way too much.  When servers take notice and see that you have no wine, your dessert has been finished a while ago, there is nothing for you to do because your backs are hurting from sitting so long, they could lose the uber-chill vibe and ask if you are ready for your check.  Only three tables remained and still took a long time to get to the table.  In the beginning, once the wine was poured, it took 30 minutes to get a menu and another large amount of time for bread.  The wait staff were nice; however, inattentive.  Laid back is the vibe I got, but they were so laid back we thought they simply forgot about us.  I get that the experience is not rushed and you are supposed to feel as if you are in someones home, but the wait and the noise took away from the delicious food.  

I really hope both the staff and the noise level could be corrected.  The food is unbelievable.  I made a point to rave to Joey Baldino about his food and did not mention any negatives.  We are still talking about the food, but my husband's back hurts from sitting so long.  Gotta be up for this type of experience.  Next time I'll bring a back pillow :).  There will be a next time as I am hoping this was a one-night glitch.",4
974,"Great breakfast.  Would definitely come again.  Highly recommend.    Next to Carrollton Market.  
Had the Southern breakfast.  Basic but excellent.  Nothing pretentious, just good.",5
975,"Two days here at the Eldorado with a group of 25 people. We have experienced the worse customer service . We just finished brunch and we're constantly badgered by our waitress about the number of people in our group. We were taking up too much space. She was a nice as a rattlesnake.
 At 17 dollars per person I would think more is better. Food was ok but you will definitely not be welcomed or appreciated. 
 Yesterday same warm fuzzy feeling at the coffee shop when we spent over 350 dollars and we're treated like castaways.

TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. ..
NO HOSPITALITY AT ELDORADO",1
976,Food is typical for Chinese delivery. The delivery however... Estimated wait time was 45 minutes. I received my order via GrubHub after a remarkably disappointing HOUR AND A HALF WAIT.,2
977,"Of course we know it is not Las Vegas, but per Tripadvisor figured it would be worth going. To sum it all up, it's a castle of secondhand smoke!  We are non smokers and have gone out to clubs which had smoking and could tolerate it more than this place!

 We were very disappointed that we could not enjoy ourselves for all the smoke. Soon as some hit the door, they were lighting up cigs. SMH.. Why not invest in some of  those high power fans to vacuum some of this smoke out??? We were not the only patrons cutting our visits short because of this. 

Nice looking hotel and heard the buffet was delicious, yet sadly we will never know... Doubt we will  ever come back unless it changes to non-smoking or clear divisions of smoking and non-smoking areas. Oh well, can not win them all. Maybe if some happy competition moves in town, things would be interesting.",1
978,"We went on a non typical day, school year mid week, so we had the luxury of being only a handful of people there  Therefore, my review may not be representative of a typical visit. 
Arrived at opening and found the off season price within reason. Bathrooms and water park were immaculate. The lifeguards were attentive and friendly. 
A star was lost because I found the water and air temp to be a tad too cold. The park was smaller then other indoor water parks I've been to. Only two big slides, one group slide, a couple of younger kids areas, lazy river and a simulated surf area. They would periodically close the big slides in order to open the surf area, for lack of staffing. A minor annoyance since that is why we were there. 
I can see how people  would be upset paying more and sharing the park with hundreds of others. But I think if your timing is right, you could have an enjoyable afternoon.
We did save money by using our AAA card. Could have saved more as it was my sons birthday month, but I didn't have proof on me.",4
979,"Food is good but expensive for what you get here I ordered a burrito for $11 guess that's just just the flour tortilla beans, rice and lettuce because it's another $3 if you want meat inside.",2
980,"Introduced to this by a friend and fell in love with it. I always make it a point to try something different each time here, especially the donuts. I don't normally have a sweet tooth, but this place changes it for me.#nomnation",4
981,"Pretty good but I wasn't blown away, especially not for the price. :P Waitress was great though--attentive and friendly.

Wildfire burger (medium rare) - I couldn't tell where the ""wildfire"" descriptor came from. I couldn't taste any of the toppings (did dig around looking for chipotle mayo and think I found it on the bottom bun). The meat was good and soft, but the burger as a whole tasted mostly plain.

Fries - Crispy and hot. So good. I was able to split this with another person.

Red curry catsup - Tasted like how I thought Sriracha catsup should taste.

Regular catsup - I could have sworn this was the curry catsup because it definitely tasted like it had curry powder in it.

Pistachio shake - Pretty good with lots of pistachios! The flavor was intense.

[10/23/14]: My second visit here solidified my 3-star impression, although now it's a pretty weak 3 stars. The coconut crunch shake was good, but my classic burger was dry and plain-tasting. I ordered it medium rare, but it came out WELL DONE. GAH. Also did not get a side of regular ketchup with my burger this time. The waitress was nice though.",3
982,"WOW! I thought I was going to write my 100th review! Woohoo... I have been putting it off long enough and I have been putting off writing a review for here as well. Well lo and behold I wrote a review two summers ago when I went with my family. Boy have things changed in two years. I had no idea the amazingness of the Schlafly Brewery. Maybe I am basing this review more off of the all the amazing beers they offer, and I enjoy, But whatever. The City Hop wasn't a bad event either, yes it was at the Tap Room (I need to eat there, then I'll review). 

Molly and our friend from Chicago, down on business, ventured in last Monday night. We got a table in the smaller dining room. Molly had a bunless veggie burger and Hannah had the BBQ pulled pork with slaw. They both seemed to enjoy them. The pork was delicious. I had the brat burger with kraut and swiss on a pretzel bun! It was unbelievable! The brat flavor is something you really can't mess up too much, and this was not at all, especially on that awesome bun! We all had the asparagus as a side, which was delicious. I had a pumpkin beer, which is something I would probably actually die for. That good. Get one if you haven't had one. Preferably on tap. Hannah had a sampler and seemed to enjoy them all for the most, my heart got real warm in my chest when she listed the Pale Ale as one of her two favorites of the six. Some thing about that Pale Ale is just comforting. The wedding I went to this weekend had it as one of their bottle choices. I am determined to have a keg of it at mine. Probably not a full keg, but a smaller one I will only fill certain people in on. I look forward to many a trips back here and am almost embarrassed about my original review... Here's to another 20 years in St. Louis with Schlafly!",5
983,"I'm sure the people who gave this place bad reviews had reasons to feel that way, but from my experience, I can say that I had a pain free transaction...

I recently bought a certified Honda Civic at Martin Main Line Honda and I never had a problem with any stage of it. I came in several days before to test drive a car on their lot before I made my final decision. Al Ubaldini walked me through the lot, we picked out 3 cars and I decided to try out the one I was most interested in. After the drive, I told Al that I would be back on Saturday to discuss things further. Obviously you will get some sales tactics from a sales person as this is how they make a living, but Al was very friendly and never pushed or made me feel like I was a dollar sign to him.

On Saturday I came back, discussed my situation with Al and told him that I expected the price to come down to a more desirable figure for me. I had done research on the Blue Book value of the car and based a starting point off of what other similar cars were going for at other Honda dealerships. Al was very easy to negotiate with because he worked with me on the number and never gave me sales pitches along the way about ""how they weren't making any money on the deal,"" ""this is an amazing offer, that nobody could beat"" etc etc. He simply said, we want repeat business so we'll get you to a number that everyone will be comfortable with... I left with a comfortable price. It was well below the other numbers that my research led me to based on all the criteria of the car. The financial guy here was also easy to deal with, I forget his name. He didn't push me on the extra warranty options and helped me deal with my insurance company to get a new policy started and get my temporary insurance card printed out.

Overall, I was never stressed, never pushed and left with a car I wanted in the price range that I was ready to pay. I would recommend dealing with Al to other people, just do the research, know what you want and be firm in your negotiations and there shouldn't be a problem.",4
984,"It's OK. Pretty good pizza, friendly service, great decor, and convenient location. 

The Pizza - I was here for late lunch and decided to order the ""Lunch Special"" - a slice of cheese pizza, salad, and soft drink for $8.00. You can add whatever toppings you desire for $0.50 each. Not a bad deal. I ordered the salad with Raspberry/Walnut Vinaigrette dressing and a cheese pizza with Italian sausage. The salad was brought out with my drink. It was a generous serving of lettuce, tomato, red onions and fabulous crunchy croutons. The salad was good, but nothing outstanding. It was also served heaped on a small plate. Keeping it on the plate while I ate was a bit difficult. 

The pizza came out in about 20 minutes. It was a huge slice of thick crust type pizza which is not my favorite. It was also so large and the the crust so thick, I had to eat it with a knife and fork (shudder). The overall taste was bland and with the thick crust it all was a bit dry. The sausage was crumbled and uninspiring. 

The interior is funky and cute and clean. The blue walls and touches of art and blousy curtains give it a pleasant friendly ""hippy"" feeling that is welcoming and casual. 

I think I would give it another try and order a personal size pizza with one of the special combinations. They also have a nice selection of beers in addition to soft drinks.",3
985,"Service stank.  Goofed up 5 orders, took us 30 min just to cash out.  Not going back!",1
986,"I was so disappointed in this meal. First of all the Shakin Bacon Fries had so little bacon that they should really take the word bacon out of the name. Our food was flavorless and when my boyfriend asked why the bbq sauce wasn't cooked in the manager proudly said, ""That's not the Red Hot and Blue way"". He told us how their meat is smoked with nothing on it. So, you get a bunch of flavorless meat on your plate. We both ordered the Five Meat Treat; they gave us plenty of food. Unfortunately it wasn't food that either one of us wanted to eat. The service was fine, just a little slow but our server told us that he was new and he seemed high-school aged; I'm such a sucker for kids who work that I give him a pass. Because the manager knew he wasn't satisfied with the food they took his meal off the check.",2
987,"I fell in love with the curry tofu wrap, mediteranean salad and the banana whips instantly. Many of the menu items seem a bit heavier than what I would typically eat which is why I don't venture to far across the menu items but, what I did have, I raved about and went back many times for.

I get a banana whip every day on my way home from the gym (obsessed!) and it would be great if they were made a little quicker since, it can become pretty cramped in there to wait. The free water with fresh citrus slices definitely helps ease the wait time.",4
988,"I was a member here many years ago (ok, five), and at the time I really enjoyed it. I was in shape and stayed in shape. Fast forward a few years (and many beers), and I have moved away and come back...both to Blue Bell and this gym. I have to re-climb the mountain, but in spite of my humbling I do enjoy this location quite a bit. Not the best gym of which I've ever been a member, but it is quite nice, rather cheap, and free of most sorts of BS. That is all I want.

They have plenty of Hammer Strength machines, and enough cardio stations during peak hours so you aren't standing around for minutes at a time not doing anything. Sure, the Devon Fitness Club beats this place for opulence (flat screen TV on every machine, anyone?), but this joint is far cheaper, so its a tradeoff. I have quite the beergut to remove but I don't feel out of place here, and that is all I wanted/needed. Just wish the music was better but I say that everywhere I go.",3
989,"I love this store! Each time I'm in Carpenteria (monthly) I visit this store and it's juice/smoothie/sandwich bar daily. Sometimes twice daily... except Sunday because they aren't open. *sad*

I love their Alien's Nectar and Green Lantern Juices - I'm addicted! Their acai bowls are out of this world delicious. Also when they make a smoothie with dates it ends up smooth (versus the place across the street that can't seemml to make juice or smoothies that flow easily up straws!)

Get the cocoa-nut smoothie with date butter..  you won't be sorry fellow chocolate lovers. Or one if the pineapple coconut smoothies... oh so good!

The prices at this store are on par with other natural grocers. Staff is super friendly and I swear they put extra love in each item. Tip them! 

I wish they were open Sunday!",5

992,"Henry's reminds me of a coffee shop you'd pop into in a little town on the East Coast before walking 5 more steps to the beach. It is quaint, welcoming and inviting, so naturally that makes me think of vacation. 

The food is delicious - and there's quite a variety of breakfast and lunch choices available at all times, as well as brunch options on the weekend. A chicken Caesar wrap at 10:30 am? Sure, no problem at Henry's. They also have a decent amount of baked goods to choose from. 

I had an Arnold Palmer to drink, since I wasn't feeling coffee on this particular day, and that was great and refreshing. I glanced at the drink menu and overall thought those prices were pretty high. So, overall, impressed with the food prices and think those are a great value, but feel the price point on the coffee is a little high.

I still think I would give their coffee a shot, as this is a cute and quiet place to get work done or catch up with friends. I'll definitely be back.

Ease of parking on East Street, also a plus.",4
993,"Went here for my brother and my birthday. Our group was a table of 12 on a Saturday night. We had great service great food and great drinks. We had the shrimp tacos, pork and beans, both burger options, filet ordered and we all loved out meals. Definitely will be coming back as often as possible.",5

995,"Went to LEX for my daughter 21st birthday!. We reserved 2 booths through Vince the manager. He was so helpful. Responded accordingly to my text messages and was very sweet in person. His information was easy to absorb and wasn't confusing when I had questions about bottle service and etc. It wasn't crowded the night we went. We arrived and was seated by the bar area. Our booths had some sort of runway and 2 poles towards the end you can dance on which was pretty cool if you didn't want to go down on the dance floor. Staff was nice. Asked us which bottle we wanted, paid for it and didn't hear from them about fees again. They did keep coming to see if we needed them to make us drinks or pour us shots... very nice young ladies. There was also a security guard who introduced himself as Chris (I hope that was his name) and let me know that he will be watching over us and if I felt we needed anything to just let him know. I recommend this place. My daughter had a blast! I would come back for sure. Thank u guys!!!",4

997,"If your a light to medium sleeper don't come here..

A nice place to stay, rooms were comfortable. Several things are right, however, one major drawback is the noise. The hotel is set up with exterior rooms and interior (atrium) rooms. We stayed in an interior room, every noise that was made in the atrium echoed and came in our room. Little noise dampening was on the wall, door and window that separates the room from the atrium.  I was woke up at 6 am by people walking by our room having a conversation,  additionally this was added to by children screaming in the atrium, I don't know if they were in the pool, it's in the atrium...",2
998,"I don't know if its just me but I feel like El Camino's quality went down a lot. 

Don't get me wrong, if you're looking for a fun place, this is it with a vast variety of drinks this is it.  Food is decent too but nothing out of the norm.  Most of the times I've come here and ordered the same thing, it wasn't consistent or maybe I remembered it to be different?  

My favorite things to order here is the vegan wings, and even though I am a meat eater, they are pretty good.  Also, their desserts are usually on point, more so than their entrees.  They had a smores bread pudding that was to die for that they removed from their menu.

If i want drinks I stop on in here from time to time but if I want food, I walk down the street to Dos Segundos that always delivers. The only bonus I like is outdoor seating area where you can hang out with your friend and people watch.",3
999,"Came to this place after seeing the reviews. The staff is nice and the place is clean, and the other customers seemed to like it. 
I'm not happy with my haircut. It's hard to mess up military styles (and I've never seen anyone have trouble with them), but after 50 minutes of the guy trying just to make the cut even on both sides I decided to leave. My hair is cut to 2 different lengths on opposite sides of my head and is completely shaven shorter than both sides all the way up the back of my head. 
By the way, their prices have gone up since the earlier reviews. They charged me $30 for something I have to go have someone else fix. That's right: $30 for their simplest haircut. I would have been willing to revisit this place on the chance that I just got a poor barber or he was having a bad day, but I don't know how this place can justify charging so much for so little quality.
Edit: the manager called me after I complained about the experience and made a generous offer to try to earn my business back. I'm not interested in returning for now but I've added another star because I appreciate the professional gesture.",3
1000,"I've always been a fan of ""chopped"" cheesesteaks, and have never found a ribeye style steak that compared...until I had my first Chink's.  Oh man, this steak simply blew me away.  It was meticulously prepared for me to order, as I sat at the soda fountain counter with my black cherry soda.  Then when it came out, with a nice side of hot peppers, I was in marvel at the fine preparation.  When I saw the ribeye style, I was skeptical.  One bite and I was a believer.  Chubby's is my all time favorite, but darn it, Chink's immediately is up there in the top 3 cheesesteaks I've ever tasted.",5
1001,"I've been here a couple of times now and now convinced I'd rather get my sushi elsewhere. The atmosphere has a kind of dingy feel to it and the service was pretty bad. Most of their rolls have cream cheese or have fried components so kind of difficult to get a healthier option. The mussels were overlooked and the rolls we got were OK. However, I will say that some of the nigiri we got was pretty good and they have some good specials.",3
1002,"Worst service! Told the hostess we wanted to sit in the bar area and she insists on sitting us in the back of the restaurant which is empty. Sat there for over 10mins with tons of staff walking by & just staring at us but no service, not even water. We finally got fed up and walked out. Horrible!",1
1003,"I had a delicious breakfast at Tuttini a few months ago.  I went back for lunch recently and was excited by their sandwich offerings, however, I was not served.  It was 1:45 PM, and their sign states that they serve lunch until 2:30 PM.  I waited in line for 7 or 8 minutes before a woman came out to tell me that the kitchen was closing.  Closing over 30 minutes early!  She said she might be able to make something to go.  So, if you can make something to go, doesn't that mean the kitchen is not yet closed?  Besides, I wanted to have a few minutes to relax in the cozy restaurant and enjoy my sandwich, not gulf it down on the street, so I left.  I got a sandwich at North Star Coffee around the corner and gave them my $10 instead.",2
1004,I love this place! It's nice to find a pizza place that still allows you to eat Vegan and gluten free. The atmosphere is very modern and eco-friendly at the same time. Try the Vegan pizza! You'd never guess it was Vegan.,5
1005,"My pizza was so good I forgot to take a picture. This is my new favorite pizza place. Ironically, this location has been two or three other pizza restaurants that previously failed. So far, Snap is getting it right. I ordered a Sweet & Slow pizza and did a custom pie with shredded cheese, bacon, chicken, and fresh basil. The flavor was pure amazingness. I know that's not a real world, but that's how I would describe it. I wanted to go back the next day, but contained myself. My only issues with Snap right now are they don't make larger pies and they overcharged me. Granted it was only .50, but if your custom and signature pies have posted prices, you have to charge the customer those prices. Other than that, I will be back to try more. I highly recommend them.",4
1006,"I used to live around the corner from the foodery, and after yesterday I will never go there again. 
If you want an expensive ass 6 pack (very close to what you'd spend if you got the same beer at a bar), old tastycakes, or to spend double what you should because the prices are so high, feel free to go waste your money here. I walked into the foodery and asked the guy behind the counter to use his phone to call a cab (my phone had died and at 11 am on a Sunday, cabs were not really around) because I had three massive bags of groceries and I couldn't carry them all the way home. Well needless to say the guy said well I'm using the phone, I offered to wait until he was done, but he just said there's cabs outside all the time and turned away. I had told him that I had already waited outside for 15 minutes and saw none available, And he just said no can't help you. Horrible customer service, and considering it's a neighborhood spot, I'm shocked at the total lack of class from this store owner, especially considering I've been shopping there for years.",2
1007,"All I can say is wow...I expected a lot more from this place.  The waiter was sub-par to say the least.  I think in the 2 hours we were there, we saw our waiter three times maybe?  The food for some was hot, but for some, was luke warm, because instead of delivering the food as it was done, they waited to deliver all of our food together.  Mushroom Ravioli with short rib meat underneath that is luke warm is NOT good eats.  The waiter never asked if we wanted dessert afterward either, just brought our check that had a pre-determined 21% pretentious tipping included in it.  We didn't have a group of 30 people, and with the fact that our waiter was almost non-exsistant, was a tip that was not well earned nor deserved.  Attention to detail and customer service should match the price tag of this place, which was way overpriced for what you get. Because it's attached to the Marriot hotel chain, you'd think that the food and the service would be much higher scale to match the price tag of the food, but evidently they missed the bus on that one...",2
1008,"This was one of my favorite spots in the city, every underrated. Until I went about a month ago, the menu change was not a great one, the chicken and waffles was my favorite item on the old menu it was sweet, savory, large portioned etc, but the new is very basic! Then the french toast has changed at well wasnt happy. Please bring back the old menu!!! The positive though, still a great atmosphere and great music.",3
1009,"I don't know why this place got high reviews.  I ordered delivery based on those and I regretted it dearly.  I ordered a standard dish, chicken pad Thai.  I unfortunately couldn't even finish it.  Lacked flavor and was over spiced.  There was something wrong with the sprouts they gave me. They smelled like they were left in standing water for a long time.   They actually made me gag both eating a few and just smelling them.  I couldn't believe it.  

Their fried rice and Thai iced tea were good (my gf said the rice was just ok and she's Filipino).  I am still just shocked at how inedible the pad Thai was.  

I won't be going back.  People, get your reviews together.  This is not a 5-Star place when a standard dish makes you gag!",2
1010,"Awful! Typical Philly ""hot spot"" that appeals to hipsters and snobs that would rather have a ""scene"" than quality dining. We ordered several pizzas. They were thin with burnt crust and room temperature. Worst of all they were $15-16 a pop! Insane. I could stay in the suburbs and go to a mom & pop joint where real unpretentious folks go and get a pizza ten-times as good for half the cost!

Plastic chairs and little to no atmosphere. The service wasn't bad and that was the high point! I hate that places like this can actually be successful. A total half-assed effort catered to mindless hipsters and wannabes that think it's cool to do the Philly thing for a few years. Real Philly people know where to get Pizza and Vetri ain't it!",1
1011,"I went last night for the first time. My fiance had the Mac and Cheese (dinner portion size) and I had the Coconut Shrimp and Fries. I hate sweet potatoes so I declined the SP fry up-sell. They pushed pretty hard to up-sell the mac and cheese by offering to add bacon or onions or whatever... Without adding anything it was great. Drink refills weren't a problem. $2.75 with unlimited refills. I refrained from purchasing the souvenir plastic mug.

The coconut shrimp were excellent. Nicely breaded. Nice sweetness. Nice crunch. I wasn't a fan of the mango chutney and actually enjoyed them without any dipping sauce.

Aside from the up-selling and the EXTREMELY quiet / soft spoken waiter who was forced to repeat himself two or three times before we understood him, it was alright.

I wanted to check this place out and I'd go probably go back and try a burger, but after that i'm probably solid not patronizing this place again. 

I didn't want a burger but I love that the Key West burger is inspired by Virgilio's which is an awesome bar (attached to a restaurant) in KW. That will def. be the one I try when I head back in.",3
1012,Nice atmosphere...terrible bland food...low moral staff....tourist spot.  As a local probably wouldn't recommend.,2
1013,"For the amount of time we had to wait youd think service would be a little better. Im not complaining about the wait at all, we knew what we were getting into, but the waitress we had was imcompetant to say the least. after we sat down she took our drink order ... never to be seen again. She came back to take our food order and thank god there was water on the table. She brings the food, its wrong. She brings the check and low and behold charges us for the drinks we never received and is literally mind blown when i ask her to take them off the bill. As some one who has worked in the service industry i know what its like to work a busy shift, but come on...",1
1014,"The Good News: 

If you attend a happy hour and sign up to win a happy hour, odds are that you will win a happy hour every 4-6 months or so.  I signed up once and have won 4 happy hours so far.  Also, the female bartenders and girls that come here are pretty attractive.

The Bad News:  

This place gets way too crowded with former frat boys.",2
1015,"Well, we have been to BJ's twice now, so here is what we think.

The good:
BJ's has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long.

The bad:
BJ's has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long.

BJ's is one of those restaurants that cannot decide if it is a steakhouse, a brew house, an Italian restaurant, a pizza parlor, a rib joint, or a burger place. As is so frequently the case with restaurants that try to do so many things, it ends up not doing any of them very well. The servers seem to have a lot of trouble answering questions, because there is such a massive amount to remember. Frequently they have to pass such tough questions as ""can I get that with mushrooms"" on to the kitchen manager, who appears to be in a black hole from which your server may never return.

On to the food. First visit we had salmon, which had a very nice flavor but was a bit over cooked. This time we first ordered calamari as an appetizer,which was nicely battered and fried with good marinara and horseradish dipping sauces. We then both ordered the rib eyes, each medium rare. The cooking was fine. The quality of the meat was terrible. We have been around a good while, and these were the toughest, most gristly rib eyes we have ever eaten, or at least tried to eat. When we arrived home, Rex the amazing wonder dog ended up eating most of them. He thought they were great. Then again, he eats cat litter.

Grandson had a burger and fries, which he gave his 8 year old's thumbs up to. If the ketchup on his face was any measure, both must have been good.

Beer selection was wide but not more than the average brew house.

So all in all, a great big mediocre for BJ's. If you are in the area of the Outlet Mall In Wesley Chapel, there are numerous other places to choose from. Think about them. Think about them hard.",3
1016,"Skip the food & stick to the coffee. Great space for reading and working. Paninis are pre-made &
 are too expensive for the quality. Panera does a better job. We had the mozzarella & tomato panini, it was cool on the inside, not as gooey as it should be.",3
1017,"I've lived in Dunedin for over 12 years. Tonight was my first experience at Kally K's. My dad wanted to go out to eat, but a restaurant he wanted to go to was closed early. We debated going to Cafe Alfresco, but I wanted to try the salad bar. The hostess (owner/manager) greeted us at the door. I am curious if the person at the hostess stand is an owner or a manager. The waitress was prompt. I was debating between the fried chicken or the 10 oz. NY strip that was on special. My father ordered the steak and because I haven't eaten a steak in probably 9 months so did I. There was nothing special about it. We both ordered med rare. The steaks were extremely tough and chewy. The strips were unseasoned and tasteless. I was just going to just suffer through it because I've worked off and on in the restaurant business for twenty years. My father really had a hard time cutting his steak. He commented to the waitress three times that our steaks were tough and chewy. She listened, said "" I'm sorry"" and walked away. At one point while trying to cut through my dad's tough steak his cheap fork completely bent. We had a good laugh. He called the waitress over and showed her his fork. She just laughed. I then asked her to get my father a new fork, before she walked away. My father did tell the waitress that he would eat the steak because he felt like he was taking it out on her. It was obvious we weren't happy. They didn't care. I asked the waitress is the 10 oz . NY strip the same as the other strips. She said yes and that they cut the steaks there. Terrible. I would not recommend this restaurant for one reason. A manager never came to our table. I ate my chewy tasteless NY strip special because I was hungry. Hey, it's just a meal. If I'm serving someone and they aren't happy with their meal I tell my manager. Believe me they would have fixed it. First offer your cu$tomer something else. I would have probably given my steak back before eating the rest of it. If the rest of the food was good I wouldn't have written this review. My dad had enjoyed this restaurant in the past so we would have been back. Maybe I should have ordered the fried chicken. No, we should have just went to Cafe Alfresco instead.",1
1018,Service was excellent but the beef on my skewers was tough and burnt.,2
1019,"I recommend getting the migas. We had to wait about 20 min to get a table but we had 5 people in our group. If you're looking for a lively place for brunch, check this place out :)",4
1020,"99% of the time I love Whole Foods. This week and last week, though, I am quite disappointed. We drive a distance to come to shop here so we always eat from the salad bar. Two weeks in a row, there is no vegan salad dressing available. They usually have 4 vegan options. Last week I didn't discover that they were out until after I had made my salad. When I asked about it, the gentleman said ""we're out til Monday. "" He didn't seem concerned or offer any alternatives so I gave him my salad and left.  This week, still no salad dressing, but I looked before I made my salad, and I purchased my own vegan dressing. Come on Whole Foods. Please don't disappoint me again.",3
1021,"New place, and I hope they keep up the great work! Great service, GREAT Food, Huge portions ( and I mean huge.), and almost every entree dish under $15! We had Jumbo fried shrimp, and they were jumbo, lighly battered, not greasy. Also had shrimp pasta, there was as much shrimp as pasta. Parking can be a bit challenging, but worth the patience.",5
1022,Best tempura and teriyaki chicken ever!!! Tempura banana and green tea ice cream the best!!!,5
1023,"I shop Target whenever possible for toiletry, household and even food items. I love the bright clean layout of the store and most items are easy to find. I also think it is great that they feature products from small businesses as a way to help the little guy out-Go Tarjay!

 On my last visit with my mom she was unable to find the bath powder. Four associates attempted to help us but in the end we left without it and my mom muttering the awful W word (((shudder))). You would think employees would be able to punch a product into an electronic inventory and see exactly where it should be; instead the emps scoured the shelves and walked the aisles. While the system fails I give service an A. 

PS. IF someone finds out where they are hiding the bath powder let me know (I will score major mom points!!). thanks :)",3
1024,"One of the worst service experience.
I ordered egg roll and the pho.
Egg rolls came out covered with burn crumbles all over and very drak color of the shell and you could the content pretty much black color as if it was almost burned or at the least fried in the last drop of over used burned oil and I could not posssibly put it in my mouth. When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned, the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check. 
Absolutely rude, not communicating, disrespectful of their customers.. 
the only reason I came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but I think it's worth a wait compared to this place if I want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy :(",1
1025,"We were told that this is THE place to eat for Mexican/Tex-Mex food in O'fallon. Wrong. The food wasn't gross, which saves this business from a 1-star, but it was far from flavor or interesting. 

The buffet we heard rave reviews about was pretty lame and didn't offer much choice. Perhaps I'm skewed by being told how awesome it was, but this was definitely one of the poorer experiences I've had at any restaurant, especially a themed one.",2
1026,"Good outdoor place right on Bourbon to listen to some jazz music in a casual setting.  We ordered their $5 drinks which were very watered down and put in tiny little plastic cups with some ice (Mint Julep, Sazerac, Brandy Milk).  We thought about ordering food, but saw what what other people were eating and decided to pass.  

One note, the table was really dirty, not sure if all outdoor places are like that in NOLA since Cafe Du Monde is like that too, but it kind of grosses me out",3
1027,"This CVS is conveniently located and pretty clean. There are times I'll have to go to another CVS since this one won't carry an item or has limited stock. The staff is helpful, but sometimes they go missing at the register and I have to hunt them down. Prices, even for a drug store, are usually on the high side",3
1028,"My family was in Nashville on vacation and our friend recommended this place for breakfast. The service was so great, everyone that worked there was welcoming, friendly and helpful. My husband got banana foster pancakes which was delicious! I got a Hershey's iced coffee and strawberries and cream pancakes. just perfect!! They brought over fresh homemade sausage for my husband. Best breakfast sausage I've ever had! If I'm ever in Nashville again we will definitely be heading back there!",5
1029,"Great location! Happy hour with $3 drafts. Other than that, you may want to head over to the Columbia Cafe @ The History Center. Seriously! As a Channelside resident wanting more food locations nearby, very disappointed in Hablo Taco. Of course we will be back (it is across the street) but next time just beer or margaritas with an order of nachos. 
Food wise: salsa is flavorless and I don't know that tomatoes are even in the recipe. For the tacos,  best flavor I've tasted is the Southern. Do NOT get there steak or pork taco!! Southern is probably better option. Shrimp taco had 1-2 shrimp at best. 
Guacamole with cheese and bacon is decent. Chips are good. Overall, food lacks flavor and some dishes are about the heat and not the flavor. 
Won't mention a name, but there is one bartender there that offers friendly service and makes a great margarita.",1
1030,"Went here for the first time a few days ago and had lunch. Although it is a chain restaurant, I really liked it. The decor was nice and provided sort of a classy atmosphere. It was not very busy so we were seated quickly but the hostess was not the greatest, basically just handing us some menus and walking away. No explanation of the menu or any specials or anything. Thankfully, our server was very nice and walked us through the menu since we had never been there. While there were a lot of options on the menu for lunch, the prices seemed to be what I would pay for dinner. It didn't seem like much of a lunch special to me. We got our drinks fast and some hot, fresh out of the oven bread that was so yummy, we quickly devoured the whole loaf. My husband got the create your own pasta with the garlic cream sauce with pene, shrimp, and mushrooms. We both agreed that the sauce was a bit of a let down. It was not very creamy or garlicy. Next time he's going to go with the alfredo. I had the meatball sliders with garlic Parmesan fries. The sliders were fantastic. The meatballs were so good, I could have been happy with just a plate of those, but putting them on the buttered buns made them even better, The order comes with three, which was the perfect amount, but the glutton in me wanted more. The fries were ok. They were very thin cut, but could have used a lot more garlic, they were pretty much just regular fries with a bit of cheese on top. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and we plan to go back to try some dinner items and maybe dessert.",3
1031,"I like the location in the former spot occupied by Cardwell's. My initial observation is that the restaurant is far too noisy to hold a conversation. If you're going to eat there with someone you want to speak to, definitely eat in the bar area or outside. The food was just OK and not impressive. For example, if I was going to Denny's and I ordered the pasta with Morreale mushrooms and and an order of sea scallops. It would've been the best meal I ever had at Denny's. Unfortunately, I was paying $70 for food that did not impress me. Both dishes were just OK. I would tell everyone it's worth eating at one time but not the second. For celebrating our wedding anniversary, it was a disappointment.",3
1032,"I purchased a Groupon for my grandson and daughter to enjoy this place 
 then we came with them and enjoyed watching them discover the fun of archery

1033,The service here is terrible. After a fill in my nail and the acrylic cracked in half there he used the blade. I called up there and the man who answered said they'll fix it. Once I got there they tried to charge me 10 to fix something that was their fault. Then the man at station 5 caught an attitude because I wouldn't let him pull my broken nail off that was still connected to my skin. He then told me he wasn't fixing my nail.,1
1034,"my vegan girlfriend and I came here for vegetarian reasons and were happy with the vegetarian bourbon chicken we had.  the service was kinda slow and meh, but that's kinda par for the course at a hipster/punk restaurant.  they always have better things to do, but never do them either.",4
1035,"It's always packed even during times that should be ""off"". What is the fascination? 

At least the service is semi-fast and the food is good by fast food standards, but not worth the wait.

Avoid it like the plague unless you can figure out when they're not busy.  I can't.",2
1036,"First time having tapas and they were delicious. The server was knowledgeable on nearby attractions and they served local microbrews. Win, win!",5
1037,"As others are writing, the atmosphere is great.  I'm surprised this has as high a rating as it does.   Probably because many are only drinking.  The service was extremely slow on a pretty empty early evening week night.  (5:30).   Food was mediocre at best.  Several people in our party feels it was all microwaved.  And to have $$ for the menu price is deceiving.  Most everyone in our party thought it was way too pricey.   We are quasi-local and will find another place next time.  Ps.  Waitress was very pleasant.",2
1038,"I love this place. Especially on a foggy day. Ive had so much fun in this tiny little joint at the end of the pier, a place offering fresh steaming seafood without a care as to who the hell you are or where you come from. They work fast and hard and I was amazed at how much food was prepped and pushed in front of avid, eager and hungry patrons of all walks.

Farm raised abalones tasted wonderful fried quickly in butter and wine and served on a bed of rice with tomatos and basil with fresh sourdough. Mouth-watering delectables,  these abalone guys support a cottage industry from the greedy ab diving pigs and asses who don't obey conservation rules or countries with no rules whatsoever. Only $17.95 gets you one of the finest delicasies from the sea. And the clam chowder is excellent.

We went back on our last day for more abs and the dungeness crabs and I felt wonderful flinging bits of crab everywhere, my care gone with the wind, and I was a mess though Jon still thought I looked killer in crabmeat. I was in shellfish heaven and I get a little crazy sometimes snapping off arms of tasty white meat.",5
1039,"My personal favorite wine and liquor store in Nashville.  The staff is usually very friendly and helpful without being pretentious.  You can ask for a $10 dollar bottle of wine recommendation without being scoffed at.  The selection is good and the prices are comparable with other liquor stores in town.  

One negative, the curb is a little bit high pulling in.  Don't gun it unless you want to scrape some rust off of the bottom of your car.",5
1040,"Convenient and Delicious.
This place is so close and we never knew it was there.  
My wife and I ordered the meat and veggie lasagna which was enough for 2 big meals for each of us and then some.
It was really good.
We got the take and bake and it was ready in an hour in the oven and we heated the sauce in the microwave.
We'll be back.",5
1041,"If I would have written this review a few years ago I would have given them 5 stars. Basically - for the weekend - I am 'too old' for this bar. During the week (after my favorite Wednesday at the Square) or during events (like the infamous Santa Crawl) Lucy's is great. Other times, not so much. 

The best deal here are the $3 mimosas. There is nothing that helps (starts) a Sunday hangover like cheap champagne and OJ.",3
1042,"Me and my wife are new to the area and were looking for a pediatrician for our baby that was just born. 

We called and left a message and they called us back we needed to get in that day and they absolutely got us in near immediately. That's the only reason they have a second star on this review. 

We were given options of a 10:00 / 10:40 / 12:00 appt and we chose the 10:00 because that was the perfect time for us to give our daughter breakfast and then she could stay with my mom until we could get back for lunch and play, yadda yadda.

We get to the office at 9:45 since we were new and they call us back at around 10:25. We wait... And wait... And wait... And I ask the nurse at the station what time our appointment was because I wanted to make sure we didn't book the 10:40 spot. She tells me it was the 10:00 and I ask if this was normal to wait this long. She said, ""Um... 50/50. We are really busy right now so...""

I look around and one door was closed and every other door was open. She said the doctor was in that room and that we were next. 

I returned to the room and my newborn at this point is wailing for food frustration and for some A/C. At 11:35 the doctor comes in and by 11:45 the appointment was over...

We will never return. Ever. 2 hours we waited to be seen. That's unheard of. Our former pediatrician saw us in less than 15 minutes every time we went. 

So if you plan on going here pack a lunch and something to drink. Not pleased, and still searching for a place for our newborn.",2
1043,I love this place. I always get the bento box and I love it. Food is awesome and the staff is very friendly. Great selection of drinks and cool sushi items as well. This is my new favorite lunch spot.,5
1044,"Sometimes what I find confusing about Yelp is that there is no real effort to separate really old reviews from the new ones... And in the case of the Daily Bread, I wonder if that's an important distinction. Many of the reviews about the poor service and dirty tables seem to be from as far back as 2010. I just haven't found that they back up my experience there so far.

I generally go for lunch when it's the most busy. And despite that, the orders are taken fast, they've yet to be messed up and the food is prepared fairly quickly. They have a decently sized outdoor area, which is great -- because honestly I have never wanted to spend much time inside. I've found that it tends to be kind of cold in there and it's often packed to the gills and loud. But the outdoor area is quite nice.

That said, I've liked all of the food I've had. The buffalo chicken melt is OK, but I was really happy with the various vegetarian options and the smoked salmon sandwich. They have some great deli-style sandwiches too. There's just a lot of very different options here, the ingredients are fresh and things are just paired together well. They have a pretty nice soup combo too, which is barely more than the individual sandwiches.

A friend of mine had some of their frosted cookies too -- whoever is decorating them really knows what they're doing. I can't speak of the taste though, as I've not tried one.

They also have four or more unsweetened ice teas at any given point, which is great. You don't see that much.",3
1045,They have made some changes in the kitchen and the quality of food has gone down. I think the same kitchen is also working at Sahms so it's par for the course. One good server has left and they let a good one go. They have a few veteran servers left. If it were not for the veteran servers and the locals I would not go to this place. The Jose Skillet is still my favorite.  The biscuits and gravy are not what they used to be. The kids still like their waffles. The bacon is not what it used to be- it's now something you would find on a burger at Wendy's.  I remember the good ol' days when this place was a four or five out of five stars.  I went to this place everyday for a couple of years. Now I go once a month. It's turned into another Sahm's.,2
1046,"This place completely exceeded my expectations, and I had a great experience. The space and equipment were very clean, the therapist was strong and responsive, and pricing schedule is very fair- the best deal in town for trained massage. Also, I was a walk-in and they saw me in less than 5 minutes.",5
1047,"Called in an order for a large group with a variety of requests; was not dissappointed. Everything was correct, the price is great, and the food is fantastic. 

Crab Benedict caught my eye initially. Served on a croissant with Cajun hollindaise sauce it was everything I hoped and dreamed. Crab cake with real crab and minimal breading like it should be, egg was perfectly poached with a great texture and runny yolk, sauce was perfect. 2 eggs on 2 halves of the croissant, picked it up like a sandwich. Chose grits for my side and was not disappointed, though I did look longingly at the fruit side which was cut up banana and strawberry(not the normal melon crap)

Everybody really enjoyed their food, even the chick who got a veggie sandwich. I definitely plan on ordering from here again.

Note to self: try the turkey fig",5
1048,"I usually come here once every 2 years only to find that yes, the food is still pretty bland...well, at least they are consistent. I've tried breakfast and I've tried dinner and the food is always less than spectacular. I usually see this spot out my car window on my way to Amy's up the road which is so much better.",2
1049,"Maybe I just tried this place when they were having a bad day or perhaps I ordered the one bad menu choice. Whichever was true, I was completely disappointed in the food. The green corn tamale was solid masa, no cheese or corn in sight. The beef taco was flavorless and the taco shell was soggy and fell apart with the first bite. With an order of average guacamole and chips, my bill was over ten dollars and I had to pick up at the counter and eat out of a styrofoam carry out box. Even their famous tortilla was uninspiring, served in a plastic bag, wrapped around a plastic fork. There are many other places in Tucson for good Mexican food. Sorry that I can't say this is one of them.",2
1050,I tried this place for takeout last night. I called in and they said 30 min but it took almost an hour for them to get my food ready. I was not impressed with the lamb curry it was runny and just not what I was expecting.

They offer a great cross section of clothing, sporting goods, electronics, housewares, and food.  Food selection is dictated by whether it's a Super Target or not.  Supers basically have a grocery store as part of the overall store.

Prices are decent but you have to compare to Wal-Mart as sometimes Target isn't as competitive.",4

I should have trust my instincts and run. But I was starving,  so against my better judgement, we ordered food. The fries rice looked like white rice randomly sprayed with soy sauce - whatever vegetables and meats were left over from the previous dish they cooked. The noodles were dry and had no taste. Beef broccoli resembles texture of leather. They give you tons of food - however, I don't want large quantity of bad food. We ate a little of our food and throw most in the trash.

And then when you finally order, you are told to order coffee separately. Wtf?  And then you have to wait in an endless line to pay. And then you have to wait at your table and wait for your name to be called. Then, to add insult to injury, the portions are TINY. I literally am on my phone looking for a place to eat breakfast... after having just finished breakfast at this joke of a place.  

So, if you are in the Nashville airport area and you are longing to pay ridiculous prices for mediocre service, mediocre decor, tiny portions and middling food, by all means come to this joint. Then we can talk about a bridge in Brooklyn I can sell to you for real cheap.",1

1065,"My first experience with Mongolian BBQ was in Westwood, CA -- home of the UCLA Bruins. I loved it. Then the versions at the mall food courts popped up in CA, and it was decent.

CI Chu's is great! Cleaner than the one in Westwood. More selection than any of the others I've been to. I love having tofu as an option, even though I'm not a vegetarian. I love the soup and the bread that come as part of the meal. It's never been crowded when I've been there. (By the way, I prefer the one on Broadway to the one on Tanque Verde, service-wise. The food is just as good.)

The only downside is that it is a tad pricey -- I only go when I'm totally starving, since you can't (usually?) take doggy bags.",4
1066,"Nice place.Seems like it would be a great place to have a few drinks with friends. Cozy feel to the place when we went here. It was 30 degrees out that night and we thought Nashville that time of year would be 50 degrees. Anyway, the menu is different,but the food was good and our server was very good.Would definitely go back.",3
1067,"Went there for sunday lunch buffet. It was fairly busy.  Host and servers were attentive. The salads were fresh. Starters tasted good but were a bit too oily. Out of the the main dishes, kadhi and palak methi matar were good. Breads were stiff. Chole was bland. Manchurian had a strange sauce. Wasn't Manchurian at all. 3 is a generous rating.",3
1068,"I do enjoy the pizza and other food at Allegros, however their customer service is less then.  The people who work there tend to be on the rude side.  They also advertise hours that they don't keep.  When school is out, they close early and don't  post this anywhere.  They just don't answer their phones.  Students are not the only customers living in the University City area.",2
1069,Me and my wife and our friends went to The Pines Tavern. The food is really good there. We were going to a show at BRT so we look up a bar in Bristol Pa. That how we found this place . It like a corner Bar it's small but nice. This was two weeks ago but I had put it up on Yelp because food was really good and I would go back again. My friend Pat had steak smash potatoes and vegetables said it was good. My wife had a burger and fries and I had shrimp with chicken with mixed vegetables and Francine had crab cakes. And we ordered on side chicken egg rolls the where really good too.,4
1070,"Not very impressive for a slow night. Service was OK but everything took a good amount of time. Drinks....20 minutes. Apps....another 20. Fries....45. Food was just ok. The spiciest wings were barely palatable, the pickle fries were mushy by the kids mess we're relish!  We've been sitting 30 minutes since they cleared our plates to get a check.",3
1071,"This place is just the ticket if you go with reasonable expectations and the understanding that everything is extraordinarily overpriced. But if you go expecting a five-star spa experience, you will be sorely disappointed.

The reason I'm OK with this place, and will probably return? It is ideal for families, even those with new babies such as ourselves. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of headaches and frustrations about this place. Check-in is a disaster...if you are staying for a holiday (we stayed for their Country Christmas, and again for Labor Day), you can expect to wait at least 30-45 minutes trying to hand off your car to the parking valets, and then another 20-30 minutes in line trying to check in. Here's a tip...if you are waiting in the parking line, send your significant other to wait in the other line...it's the only way to survive.

But there is so much to look at and explore for little kids...waterfalls, water fountains everywhere. And it is so big inside that you can take them on a walk and they will fall asleep lickety split. Food places inside the Gaylord are uniformly lousy and criminally expensive. For mediocre food, go next door to Opry Mills Outlet mall. The rooms are a little the worse for wear, and can really use renovation (though they claimed to have renovated after the flood). But the pool areas are really well done and perfect for the little ones...ours really enjoyed herself. 

If you prepare yourself to be price-gouged on everything, it can be quite a nice experience. It is the perfect place for us.",3
1072,They got fine ass dudes and chicks here food is good too but this emo kid kept screaming in the kitchen getting all booty tickled and shit,5
1073,"Excellent service and creative brunch-style entrees. In a neat part of town. A little pricy but you get your money's worth, portion-wise, so you'll prob have some leftovers for a snack.",5
1074,"The staff at the spa are incredibly friendly and professional, but the rest of the staff are sub-par. It's too big, I think, to provide good customer service. I got lost getting to my room as the front desk staff did not tell me the correct directions (he even gave me a map where he highlighted the wrong way!!) The food and service at the Conservatory Wine Bar are AWFUL! The Margherita pizza literally was a flatbread with tomato paste as the sauce (and burnt tomatoes!).  None of the housekeeping staff will say hi in the hallways...which is a sure sign they are not happy here! Too bad...what a gorgeous hotel to mess up!!!",1
1075,"So I go to this restaurant a lot with my best friend but I went last night with my boyfriend and it wasn't that great! I understand they were super busy but it took 20 mins for our order to be taken and then our food came out before our drinks and I had to ask the waitress three times for them. She said she was waiting for them to get made? It doesn't take 35 mins for a margarita and a corona!  Our food was good we ordered guac and chips which tasted good and the taco salad with chicken. The taco salad was a little disappointing, it looked big but was mostly tortilla chips under a little bit of lettuce, but still good. Finally I was fed up with not getting our drinks and asked another waiter. He  brought them right over and said they were sitting there for a good 20 mins. The waitress then came over to tell us she just forgot about our drinks. Ummm???? Okay.  Thanks for letting me know you totally forgot our order. I think next time I won't go when it's so busy. I like it better when it's dead in there or for lunch.",3
1076,"I bought a groupon for One haircut, style and conditioning for $79 and can't use it because i had made an appointment but had to cancel 4 hours before because I had family emergency. They told me that it required 24 hours to cancel which is not stated anywhere in the groupon itself. Also had problem with them before when they did not let me use the amount I paid for and groupon had expired.",1
1077,"I have to revise my review after finding many bones and pieces of inedible meat in the meat/veg combo plate I took home. I usually get the vegetarian dishes with friends, so this was the first time I'd tried their meat. I don't know if it's the norm for them to have bits of bone and inedible fat/gristle, but it made me very sad. I've had the meat dishes from other Ethiopian places around the country and this is the first time I've encountered this.",3
1078,"Terrible. I don't know how many properties they manage but one hand does know what the other is doing. We've been spending months trying to get appliances fixed. Their tactic seems to be ignore the request as long as possible then say ""maintenance"" will look it which doesn't happen. Then start the cycle again.",1
1079,Tasty food but appears to be crashing slowly. We had trouble finding the entrance as the old entrance has closed. The food was really good but a bit pricey. A great experience but I think their hay day is over :-(,3
1080,"Meh.
Just ordered lunch takeout. Not sure how you can mess up an order when there wasn't a single person in the restaurant. First we ordered soup, me egg flower, him, wonton. The egg flower was bland and had so much green onion in it it was over powering.  He actually received WOR wonton soup. Not sure why these places advertise plain wonton soup on their menus if all they serve is WOR wonton soup. There IS a difference. 

I ordered the chicken and broccoli lunch special, what I got was chicken and vegetables. Granted, broccoli IS a vegetable but when all you want is broccoli and chicken and what you get is everything BUT broccoli, your parade has been rained on. 

He ordered Kung Pao and honestly, I'm so upset not getting my broccoli chicken that I didn't even ask if he liked it.  

Won't return here.",1
1081,"I took my car to have the left headlight replaced, in Oct 2015. the price was reasonable. I had to take my car again in Dec 2015, because the headlight wasn't installed correctly(facing downward) it was fixed (no charge). And then again back to Sears auto Jan 27th because my headlight had gone out! At this point my blood is boiling! Because of employee negligence! Couldn't get it right the 1st time! Although I will say I wasn't charged, not that I would have paid for a headlight that I had already paid for 3 months ago! My headlight on the drivers side was replaced 2 yrs ago and as of today has not been replaced! Smdh.  I will NEVER TAKE MY CAR HERE AGAIN! Stay away!! Small details were overlooked. Needless to say, I didn't get good customer service and it's a good distance from my home, but close to my work.",1
1082,So I love this gym. The entire 2 years that I was a member I loved it because it fit my needs exactly. I have since cancelled my membership due to leaving for work nowadays at 530 am leaves me little time to actually go but I am hoping one of these days my work schedule changes and I can start going again. My favorite part would have to be the large amount of cardio equipment that was usually readily available and the usual staff I encountered was always incredibly friendly. When I made the decision that I needed to cancel I was a little nervous because I am insanely non confrontational but the process was smoother than I could have asked for. Within an hour of sending my email through the website I had an email back from the manager and I really respect that. I would have to say the only thing I wish was different about the place would be the hours. I have a long commute and having them open earlier (or later) would be very beneficial.,5
1083,"So disappointed! This has been one of my favorite annual spots! The hurricanes are amazing! We decided to grab a bite to eat while we were there. The prices are outrageous and the service sucked! My husband discreetly let them know it was my birthday the cup of ice cream with sprinkles and choc syrup arrived as the staff sang....way before our meals were delivered! Who does that? Our waitress was not personalable at all and had no sense of humor!
Hopefully next year will be better! Til then enjoy your time in Hudson!",3
1084,"enjoyed the atmosphere.  the cannabis infused drink was a bit toooooo strong.  Other than that, it was a great visit but not a place I would go monthly.  A bit overpriced and over hyped.  They didnt even have any desserts we wanted to try.  That was very disappointing.",3
1085,Hotel was clean and comfortable. We had a very spacious room. The hotel staff was wonderful and friendly. Stanley and Danielle you two rock!,5
1086,"So meijer is amazing and so convenient! However, the starbucks is always a hit or miss and the employees don't seem to be trained right because I've noticed every time they have to pull a sheet out to see how much it is and its never the same price.. my drink wasn't good at all this morning and when i told the lady it didn't look right she poured some of my drink out and just put more milk in it to make it taste better. Wasn't really wanting to pay $4 for a cup full of milk but she didn't seem to care so why bother even saying anything.. :/",3
1087,"Yes the selection can not be beaten

However....

several of their beers are well over 3 months past their bottling date. 

If brewerys were aware of this they would not supply

Check the canned on date before you buy",3
1088,"Fantastic.  I've had everything and it's all fantastic.  Love their experimental menus.  People are awesome and friendly.  They are very clean as well.  You can't go wrong with anything you get.  I see a lot of reviews for the tea, but the coffee wins hands down!  
Lately I have really been enjoying the short rib tacos.  They are great!  I really like the curry but its so much food I can't usually finish it and I hate wasting.  
There is always a wait, but it's worth it.  

This is where it's at people, if there were open on the weekends or had a restuarant, i'd eat there even more! :)",5
1089,"This is apparently a favorite among some folks I work with, but last night was the first time I'd tried it. I'm glad I did!

The upstairs seating area was pretty sparsely populated on a Wednesday night, but there were some folks watching Game 1 in the bar downstairs - we knew about it because of the hoots when something good happened for the Cards. 

The drink menu was diverse and yet manageable. Quite often when I go to some restaurants in places like St. Louis or Denver, the drink menu seems to be competing for who can use the most trees to document the amount of alcohol they have available. For someone who is terrible at making choices, I hate those places, since there's just TOO much good stuff! Kudos, Bailey's Range, for helping those of us who are indecisive!

I ended up ordering a red wine to go with by burger - interesting choice, I know, but I was NOT feeling beer last night for whatever reason. I ordered the Smoked burger, which has caramelized onions and cheese and rooster sauce. It was awesome. The bun was soaking up all the delicious grease from the cheese and the meat, and the whole experience was just great. 

I would definitely recommend this place for burgers - there wasn't much else on the menu to choose from, but this would be a great hit-the-spot place for a burger craving!",3
1090,"This is a great & cute little shop/antique store. The woman who recently bought the store is very friendly! I found an amazing set of canisters for my kitchen there, & they were truly vintage! I will continue to visit this store every once in awhile, as she gets new stuff in occasionally. She has a pretty decent selection of vintage clothes, accessories, furniture, home decor, antique kids toys, kitchen wares, and more! A fairly large selection of vintage Pyrex dishes as well, which I know is a fairly popular item! Definitely check this store out! The prices are fair & you will more than likely find at least one thing that you will want to buy!",5
1091,"I don't think I was as impressed with some of the other reviews in here.  It's a small place not quite of the 'hole-in-the-wall' nature.  Off-street parking is available.  The menu is simple and traditional... so if you're looking for the texmex, don't come here. 

Everything about it was average for this type of Mexican restaurant in Norristown.  The food wasn't bad, but I've had better.  I would go back.",3
1092,"Terrible service , love the food from bob Evans but this location really need some improvement in their service. Went in with my family & didn't have a server to offer me a drink or nothing at all, after being seated there for like  10 mins. There was a waitress keep going back in forth the same road but didn't even bother to offer us a drink or nothing. Two servers then came by and said sorry because for there was a misunderstanding about who was  going to serve our table ?? 
Really ? It wasn't even that busy. 

Food was good but service very slow.",2
1093,"Love this place!  Best fresh baked bread around and an awesome place to come in the mornings for a nice breakfast. 

I had just been in San Francisco and had crazy good toast at The Mill. There's really no one doing toast in So Cal except for here. Huge thick pieces of toast served with fresh ground peanut butter and homemade strawberry preserves. Seriously - this whopping piece of toast was enough for 2 people. 

I know they supply a number of local restaurants with their bread but it's great to stop in here and pick up a loaf for yourself at home. In the mornings, they often have a selection of their fresh loaves cut up for you to sample. Fantastic!!",4
1094,"Here with a large group of co-workers (15).

We had a 40 minute wait, despite calling in advance to arrange.

Server was very attentive. Drink and appetizer orders taken quickly after being seated.

We had numerous appetizers for the table... Fried Macaroni and Cheese, Fried Calamari, Buffalo Blasts and Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread. Some also had Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip. My favorite was the Macaroni & Cheese and the Buffalo Blasts (recommended by server).

I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp. Very good and just the right spice.

I had to top it off with the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake, since it is the Cheesecake Factory. Is it even allowed to not order dessert? Just the right consistency and plenty large enough to share.",4
1095,"Christ, this place is noisy - wouldn't go back again.   The area is really nice but there's no public transport nearby.  Go to the 4 points (a lot cheaper) or the Sheraton City Center if you're an SPG points collector.",1
1096,"We did not expect to see a fist fight(6/9/2018) among staff members. What's more is we were surprised that they were not fired on the spot. 

The manager did find time to curse at them in front of customers, but no time to apologize to the customers who witnessed the fight. Pretty much pretended it didn't happen.

We will be avoiding this place in the future as frankly if there is that much strife spilling out of the kitchen when will they take it out on a customer.",1
1097,"I was excited about the opening of this restaurant. The location is amazing and I felt it would help to welcome the cruise visitors as well as provide ""revitalization"" of the area. I don't know that they know anything about Mexican cuisine, but then again, the choice of name should have told me that. It might be an intent to be witty, but they know about mexican food as much as they speak a language that does not exist. Was the food Tex-Mex? no. Was it, maybe, a glorified franchise version of what a taco could be? close. The location is fabulous. Tons of potential there. The place itself is like a franchise is. Nothing peculiar or memorable. The music is loud and definitely not in Spanish. It is a try to compete with Hooters. Tons of very young and inexperienced servers who stood around the kitchen-dispensing counter that can be seen by all the patrons sitting around. All expressions of waiters and staff easily read. It is a new place, and we were instructed that most of the menu was not yet available. Quite limiting as of right now. We were given the standard chips and salsa of some restaurants. The chips were crisp and thin. Lovely, the actual problem was how to scoop up the guacamole and queso fundido we ordered with them. They crumbled and broke every time. We ended with a kind of tortilla soup/puree of sorts. The salsa was rather sweet. It tasted like marinara with some roasted chiles in it. Not spicy at all, and I ought to know because everything is spicy to me. The guacamole was definitely fresh. Want to know how I know? I had a whole avocado slice inside the green tasty mush. Needless to say, the thin tortillas presented a challenge. We cut it in pieces and used a knive to spread it on the tortillas as if they were crackers. Our order was brought to the table and about three minutes later, a confused waiter brought another for us (of the same we were eating) and was baffled as to what to do with the obvious mistake. She returned to the counter and the whole crowd of staff members seemed uncertain as to what to do with the extra queso fundido, refritos and guacamole. We ordered tacos! yes, they hablan taco! we got: cold flour tortillas, stiff upright and if you tried folding them into a burrito they broke. Sounds familiar? we have all bought ""la Banderita"" and eat them unheated at home. I wanted steak taco, but was told they had ran out of the meat (it was 5 o""clock on a Sunday) so I decided to go for chicken... it had ONE texture, As if it came from a can. It was also cold. the toppings and their runny juices of veggies cascaded to the plate. The same story happened with the beef tacos. Cold and runny. The hamburger (yes, they speak hamburguesas too) was charred but almost raw inside. And cold. The server asked us how our food was. I aswered with a cold: ""interesting..."" He never bothered to ask as to what I meant. There were not desserts or coffee offered. Apparently not a place to linger. Our server passed us by and we asked for the bill. He immediately took it out of his pocket and placed it on our table. He was psychic enough to somehow know we would not want anything else. Ever.",1
1098,"We took a group of boys for a birthday party dinner and had a great experience. The waiter was really patient and helpful and easily handled our energetic group. 
The food was delicious - although since it was our first time at Brixx, we were a little sure posed by the small size of each pie. The taste made up for it, though. We'll definitely be back!",4
1099,"The 4 and 5 star reviews for ReAnimator Coffee must be paid for because their coffee is not worth paying for. Hands down, worst coffee I've had since McDonald's was everyone's go to for a cup of coffee. Too many great coffee spots out there to bother with this one. #verybelowaverage #lightroastisgross",1
1100,"A colleague and I were in town on business and stayed at the attached hotel.  We stopped in here on two occasions during our stay.  The first experience was great.  We wanted a quick appetizer before meeting friends.  The BBQ nachos were delicious.  A decent-sized portion. Not too large and enough ""stuff"" to make your tastebuds happy. I also tried their in-house beer.  It was pretty good.  I was surprised.  Our bartender, Kevin, was very friendly.  Turns out he's also a damn fine musician too!  

Now, our second experience was quite the letdown.  We popped in for lunch.  I tried the fried bologna sandwich.  I was intrigued by something new.  I shouldn't have been.  It was a bit too fried for me and on plain old bread.  I opted for American cheese, which looked plastic-y and didn't cover the entire sandwich.  I felt slightly ill afterward, perhaps from the grease?  My colleague had the brisket sandwich.  She said the flavor was okay but that it was super fatty.  She also didn't feel great afterward.  

So, maybe stop in for an appetizer and music, but then head out?  I was disappointed that lunch wasn't as positive of an experience as lunch. Whomp whomp.",3
1101,"I saw all the five star ratings and called for heat repair. I was given a two hour window and a promise of a phone call. It was raining and I knew things were probably running behind for service calls. I called and was told there was no need to change the time.  I called a half hour after the scheduled window had elapsed and was told he was heading my way. Two hours later, I called again and got a recording telling me they were not taking calls. I never got a call or any form of professional courtesy. I waiting for three and a half hours for a no show. I was polite and understanding but that was just plain rudeness. Family Air perhaps has so much business it does not need new clients. I just wish they would have said so. The woman answering the phone was nice,  but not very considerate or up front.  I had made clear to her that I was sitting in my truck doing paper work as to not disturb the tenants. Just a courtesy call makes all the difference!
UPDATE: I am changing my one star to three because of the nice civil words from the owner. Thanks",3
1102,"LOVE this place!!  The ironic thing is that this restaurant is in the Meadowood Mall Food Court and it is one of our favorite restaurants in the Reno area.  The first time we tried it we loved it so much we went back 2 days later.  We have been back a few more times since. The Shrimp Scampi is absolutely delicious and the Fish Tacos are the best my husband has ever had.  Can't wait to try their Fish And Chips which seems to be their signature dish.  Around the holiday season they were even selling their Wild Caught Alaskan Cod frozen by the pound to take home. I don't know if they do that year round.  It was $7.95 per pound, which is a great price.  Love the place and we will be back",5
1103,"The Grand Hyatt in Tampa Bay is one of the best resort experiences my wife and i have had in awhile.  We visited Tampa Bay recently and due to the reviews on multiple websites we decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt.  Here is a rundown of my experience:

- Staff:   The staff is hands down the best staff I have ever encountered.  My wife and I are not high rollers and we were not there for business, yet were treated as such.  Due to the fact that we were there during a Tropical Storm, we got to know the bartenders (especially AJ and Alyssa) quite well and they treated us as family.  We had discussions about everything from their jobs to their families.  We even got a chance to talk to the Assistant Manager on the last day and tell her about our positive experience.  Later on that night, she sent us a handwritten card, free snacks, and a free movie pass.  This staff actually cares about you and your experience.  Absolutely fantastic 5 out of 5 stars.

- Hotel Grounds:   The grounds are beautiful and actually contain a nature trail.  It is right next to the airport, but you would not know it staying there.  They have a shuttle to and from the airport which is free to the guests.  They also have staff that will drive you anywhere on the resort for free in a golf cart, which is pretty awesome.  Unfortunately due to the tropical storm we did not get the opportunity to experience the entire resort.  We used the pool on the resort side which was clean with a nice small bar.  When the bar is not staffed they have a waiter that will come and serve you.  The rooms are very clean and modern.  I recommend getting a water view which looks out on Tampa Bay.  

- Food:   We ate only at the lobby bar (1823 Lounge) and Oystercatchers.  We had the Sunday brunch at Oystercatchers which was fantastic and had dinner there one night.  It is a little pricier but worth it not only for the food but for the beautiful views.  1823 Lounge also has a solid brunch and really good bar food.  We ate there multiple times and had no complaints.

All in all this was a great experience.  The next time we go to Tampa we will definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt.",5
1104,"The ribeye (medium) was amazing! Seriously so big I highly recommend splitting I couldn't even finish my half 
Butter mushrooms were also very good, not crazy about the ceaser salad but still was good. Overall, I would recommend to try if you come to Nola!",5
1105,"Awesome coffee, great service.  Friendly staff.  I love coming to this place on weekends.  I always go with the cortadito, which is perfect and consistent every time.  The kombucha on tap is always a plus, as well very cool t shirts and caps that are fit for any style.  I live about 15 miles away but don't mind stopping by on weekends.",5
1106,"The closing and opening timings are off in Yelp... closing time is not 10 pm. The chef goes home at 9 pm. 

We were travelling from North and almost reached there little before 9 pm. Wanted to order ahead of time.We called to confirm they are open, and also order some food so that they are there soon after we reach. They said that the chef went home. I explained that we saw their business timings in yelp and are travelling from far. They asked how many we were. When we said we were 3, they started the old story. Chef gone home... Then why do you ask how many in your party?  

They are not very polite or accomodating I must say...

Hann Dynasty is  better than this place behaviour wise, and they speak English better.",1
1107,"After trying to find a place to eat for 30 min since every thing was closed. Mind you we went on the Fourth, we decided to eat here. We were welcomed with friendly smiles. Our waiter came and quickly took our orders.the atmosphere was great, it was not busy at all. We order the taste of Buyou and crab and shrimp Alfredo. The food came out quick and was very tasty. The only thing that could of been better was the seasoning on the pasta and there could of been more meat in the gumbo. But overall the food was great. Will come back again",4
1108,Just ok.  They have a one parking spot policy per room which was inconvenient.  The air conditioner worked great and it served its purpose as a place to sleep.,2
1109,"Dang, I went the whole summer without doing this!  Good thing I got the last one of the season. 

This sort of event is always a lot of fun, as it really shows off the small but growing food truck scene present in our city.  It's a great chance to showcase what they've got and get exposure.  It is especially nice to have gatherings like this since it seems we rarely see the trucks just around town during the week, and I love the opportunity to browse the selections and grab some various random things to munch on.

If you've experienced Food Truck Fridays, then you know the drill.  A bunch of trucks parked together, you choose the ones that strike your fancy, and spend the rest of your time hanging out and enjoying yourselves.  Feed the Camel, occurring on Hump Days throughout the summer, is a much smaller-scale affair hosted down by the river at the McKinley Arts Center.  The trucks are parked under and around the Keystone Bridge, and attendees can grab their food and drinks then find a table or nice grassy spot on the lawn.  It's a nice way to break up the week, and let some other trucks who may not be at the Friday festivities show their stuff, too.  There tend to be far fewer people at this event than Food Truck Fridays, so parking access is easier, the lines are shorter, and the entire atmosphere is way more laid back and chill.  Occasionally there will be music or other activities here, as well.  Such as tonight, with Archie from the baseball team entertaining the kids.

The selections run the gamut of variety.  From hot dogs to brisket sandwiches, vegan to hot wings, tacos to corn dogs.  Even with only about a dozen trucks and stalls present, you get a really good range to choose from.  I ended up with some Latin-Asian fusion rice balls from a new truck, a great chorizo hot dog from Bam Dogs, washed it down with slushy drink from the Mr. Margarita, and topped it off with a scoop of gelato from Bibos.  It was certainly an eclectic evening, and browsing through the menus at each place is half the fun.  Prices range from a few bucks and go upwards from there depending on what you get and how much of it.  Most all places take cards, but bringing cash just makes things way faster and easier all around.

If you haven't been this year, put it on your calendar for next summer.  Everyone should definitely come and check it out for themselves.  Food and fun, can't argue with that.",5
1110,"The worst!!! We waited in line for 2 hours while they let ppl cut in front of us...when we finally get in...order drinks and food it takes 23 min to get our food..nachos....all bottom of the barrel chips...server says NOTHING!!! ...and still no 2 beers and a marg....never come...I do this for a living...there is no excuse for food to beat drinks...if this is happening the MOD on duty is NOT doing their job helping and backing up the staff....drinks come..we order shots....wrong shots came out not what we ordered...then we get charged for 6 shots!!! Sorry wrong again.... Nothing to fix the problem...then give us the wrong bill!!! We pay bill because obviously we are not here for customer service...and it's a few dollars cheaper...don't think we would have gotten much better. Surprising how a establishment can treat their guests this way and expect them to come back....wait it's a tourist spot so why would they care. Seriously you couldn't last on your guest services...good thing your a ""TRAP"" makes me wonder if our ""stellar"" service is because of poor management and training. Good luck..hate to think a big corporate restaurant like you can take out honest wholesome business with good service and honest and integrity. Never again",1

1112,"I was excited to try this restaurant because I love dosa, but in the end was very disappointed. We walked in the door and while we were looking for a hostess, one of the waiters jerked his head to indicate where we should sit. Now I'm not normally picky about ambiance, but the floors were covered in something slick and the place just looked dirty. A trip to the restroom to wash up sealed the deal. It was filthy. 
We ordered the vegetable samosas, which were quite good, but we only got two, with no plates on which to eat them. Next came the Bollywood dosa and Grandma's dosa. I guess I'm just used to a different style of dosa, but these barely had any filling, and the bread was not as crispy as I'm used to. 
After waiting for about ten minutes for our check, a waiter finally came and we had to ask for a check before he told us that we should pay up front. At least, that's what I think he said. 
Sadly, I don't think I will be back unless they make some changes.",2
1113,"I came for the pho and to be honest I don't think there is one better then another. I find the same taste in all but I did order orange chicken with rice. That plate was good. Small location never thought food would be good but would agree with everyone in service. Can't even get a ""how's it going today"" or ""thank you have a nice day"" it's more like ""what you want"" and ""your total is"". They can't even check up on people and see how the food is. Also what is up with the soda cans. I like getting refills. I would rate the more like a 3.5 star.",3
1114,"What is the big deal with this place, anyway? People line up around the block, and for what? Hype, as far as I can tell. There was absolutely not a damn thing special about my breakfast. Maybe a step up from IHOP, but not deserving of a long wait by any standard. Large portions, sure; but you can get that most anywhere in the South for breakfast. I have nothing special to tell you about my meal, or my friends' meals which I tasted. Just standard breakfast fare. And my breakfast potatoes are WAY better! I don't know, I would skip this place unless you're starving and there happens to not be a line that day. I'd rather eat at Noshville even.",2
1115,"We got to stay at Days Inn for free for a night so that was great.  The parking is $15 with in and out privileges but you need your room key to get in, so best to park in front and check in and then head to the adjacent parkade.  The lobby has chairs and sofas, nearby washrooms which require a room key, and an exercise room with a few cardio machines. 

The elevator is old and there's a sign a maximum of 5 people.  I don't think more than 2 people would fit if they both had luggage.  The stairs are convenient as they also lead to the floors in the parkade too.  The room was basic and comfortable.  To the left was the bathroom sink and across from it were coat hangers.  There was a door into the toilet and tub.

The room had 2 Queen beds, a little table with 2 chairs, and a dresser with TV.  There's no mini fridge but a small coffee maker.  On certain floors there's an ice machine and vending machine.  Our room faced 106 Street and in the evenings when you look out, there's a bright light from the hotel shining up at you.

Although the bed was comfortable, my sleep was interrupted by people talking in the hallway and before bedtime, I could hear people running in the hallway.  The location is good being downtown and within walking distances to restaurants and Tim Hortons.

For a free stay, it was good and decent for those that want to save their money for other activities in the city.",3

Got concrete reviews, I've been Yelping for years,
When I drop those 3 stars, you know I am being sincere,

Other Yelpers can't win, I make em rust like tin,
Zaikka's Indian food is like a partial win,
Because their food isn't bad as can be, but you got my words on your screen,
I say their flavors are muted, like the color pea green,

1119,"I don't know why i had such high expectations of this farmers market, but I did.  I guess I thought it would be similar to those I find at the beach cities of San Diego.

I was a little shocked at how small it was.  It is one of the bigger farmers markets that I have been to, but I guess I still had those expectations.

The location is really nice because you can also stop by state street for an additional outing.  However, I wasn't a fan of the group of homeless people and beggars that you have to walk through to enter the market.

In terms of the vendors, they have the typical fruits and veggies, eggs, meat, flowers, etc.  I was a fan of this pie that I was given a sample of on my way out of the market.",3
1120,"This is the first time I tried this place and I was really impressed, the food was very tasty...I wouldn't say authentic. ..but still good. Service was great (a smidge sugary sweet) but it's better than having some angry b as a waitress. The only thing is that the restaurant is in the hood. I grew up in this neighborhood and would never come here at night lol.  Happy dining",5
1121,"Let me start by saying buying a car is an intimidating process. I feel like I am playing poker with someone who can see all of the cards while I can only see my cards. I felt well prepared and needed to use all of my preparation to get what I considered to be a fair deal (time will tell whether I really got a fair deal) on a used (pre-owned is what they like to say) car. Do your homework (KBB.com, Edmunds.com etc) As long as the car performs like I expect it to over time, I will be happy. Sam Ladd was the salesman who always treated me courteously and let me drive lots of cars while I was deciding what vehicle I wanted. I drove everything from subcompacts to full sized SUVs. I visited many dealerships I chose Toyota of Santa Barbara because they ultimately had the vehicle that I wanted. I bought what I believe will meet my families needs. The negotiation process was business like and I believe that Frank Flores the sales manager was up front with me and answered my concerns. Be prepared and stick to your position throughout the process.",3

I have personally witnessed the staff using dirty brushes to apply makeup on another customer's face. Any amateur makeup artist knows that this is a prime way to potentially spread germs and bacteria. Keeping costs low is an important factor of running a business, but that should not extend to such practices. Some of the staff are very friendly and lovely. Others will purposefully avoid your gaze and fumble with bottle caps rather than answer friendly questions about skincare.
Ugh. Just, ugh.",2
1124,"I've been back and forth over this since eating here yesterday.  Mrs. S and I were excited to finally be in the area for dinner, as we are huge fans of Bailey's Chocolate Bar, and figured we would love the Range just as much.  

However, we were displeased with our visit!

For starters, I had been joking about he new trends with bacon flavored deserts, and joked about checking the menu for a bacon shake.  Little did I know there was a bacon shake on their ""boozy"" menu.  I was feeling adventurous so I ordered this mixture of ice cream, caramel, candied bacon and Makers Mark liquor.  At $9 it was one of those situations that I generally avoid, because $9 for a drink that I know NOTHING about is a risk I just don't take.  And if I ever had any questions of WHY I don't take these risks, the bacon shake did it for me.  This shake is tasted in levels.  First you get the liquor (YUMMY!).  That's your first sip, ice cream and liquor.  Next you get the caramel.  By the third or fourth drink, I was getting chunks of bacon.  Not so yummy at this point. For me it wasn't about the bacon alone.  It was the tremendously sweet caramel, with the salty yet sweet bacon, all mixed into one thing.  It was too sweet, too much to handle, and at $9, too much money to go out on a limb for.  

For dinner, I ordered a bison burger (forgot to order cheese!) with fries and honey mustard sauce.  Mrs. S got a regular burger with fries and cheese sauce.  My burger was decent, not bad, but not the best.  Mrs. S was not as excited about her burger, mostly because the ketchup wasn't your every day flavor.  I tolerated the different style but I honestly just am not a fan.  As for the fries, they were good.  The cheese sauce was much better than the honey mustard, mostly because the honey mustard tasted more like spicy mustard.  Maybe a mistake was made, maybe not, hard to say.

All in all, Bailey's Range was just ""ok"" for me and the wife.  I am torn between 2 and 3 stars as I write this review, for the simple fact that if someone were visiting and asked to go here, I would probably suggest passing on it, (at least if I was expected to be a part of the group) and point them in a different direction.  I think the most fair review I can give here is 3 stars, as part of my issue with Bailey's Range has to do with taste, and for me this isn't my style of food.  Service and atmosphere are both ok as well, but really when I think of a 4-5 star place, it should transcend tastes and be inviting for people who usually do not eat a certain style of meal or cooking.  Bailey's does not do this for me.  It's not exceptional to me.  It's just, ""ok.""

So here goes, 3 stars for Bailey's Range and a new list for my followers.  Just not my cup of tea.  A fair rating for a place that just isn't my cup of tea, but some might still find value in the experience.  That seems fair, right?",3

1126,"Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago.  We ordered the 2-roll lunch special, but ended up getting brought the wrong rolls... twice.  When we finally got our correct order, the rolls were small and pretty sub-par. They get a second star because they let us keep the rolls that they served us by mistake, but I won't be back.",2
1127,"So I'll put this review in context by saying that I've never actually stayed overnight here, and that I'm basing my review on my experiences at an event held at this hotel. So my specific comments regarding food service, etc. are specific to a particular evening and whatever the organizers of this event decided when negotiating things with hotel staff. Still, I wouldn't recommend this hotel for food service or event planning as a result: it wasn't bad but it wasn't exceptional either.

Firstly the lobby is under renovation. Which is fine, I've stayed at a multitude of hotels over the years and/or attended events at them while construction is going on. And that's fine. It didn't look great as we were waiting for the elevator to take us to the Penthouse floor for our event (and the elevator was very slow) but that didn't affect our enjoyment of the event at all. Once we got to the room, I really liked the city view from the penthouse floor. The room was spacious and the sound system seemed to work effectively. Although the sunset was blocked by other buildings it was still a nice view.

The staff that was serving us seemed new to their positions and lacked confidence. This is not an issue really unless it stems from other issues that I'm not already aware of being in existence. They seemed to be sincerely trying to do a good job. Still the job they were actually succeeding at doing was not nearly up to the standards of average food service staff (even though they were really only pouring coffee/tea and clearing tables) at other hotel functions I've attended over the years.

The food was unremarkable. The roast beef was incredibly (surprisingly) dry, which was a huge disappointment. The perogies were remarkably bland/strange. I appreciated the fact that real bacon bits were on offer and that the pasta salad was good, but the Caesar salad had too much dressing and the cheese platter was unremarkable. The cabbage rolls were also rather bland. Although I didn't try them myself, the dessert squares were apparently overly sweet according to the reviews of the other guests at my table. I really did like the black forest trifle, however! It was rather delicious, but did not make up for the rest of the meal. Even my tea was sub-par, though that might be partially the lack of options for tea flavours I was offered, and partially because I'm not a huge fan of Higgens and Burke tea.

All in all this venue might suit the budgets of many folks for special events and whatnot, but I can't consciously recommend it for those purposes.",2

I don't consider us as heavy eaters and I do not want to order two entrées. However, I do expect that the dinner portions to be larger for the price. Also, the hummus is always good and fresh tasting, but why does Zoe's always serve it in such small portions?  Just very odd.",3

Took a few bites of my chicken, then found the manager and handed him my tray back, told him the food was disgusting , and with no response from him, I just left still hungry.
My daughter convinced me it was just a fluke and asked me to try it again. I went through the drive through and I have to say they have a very similar operation to ordering (like In-n-Out) when they are busy. Very nice. However, it was still crappy food. They do have a very nice ice tea.

We got the thin crust pizza which had some interesting flavors, but nothing special. I think pizza is like sex- it's always good, sometimes amazing. This was ho hum at best. Try Dewey's instead.

I asked was I charged or did they just forget he told me he never heard me say my order. Which sticks but ok. But I said well why did they give me the mojo pork dipping sauce if it he didn't hear me? He said didn't hear me and is that's it. Little frustrated because i only have 30 mins to eat after I get home. 30 mins I'm eating with my girlfriend now I don't have my sandwich and he just has a attitude like oh well it's all cool.

Very basic, plain rolls which is what he likes and what he orders at other sushi places all tge time. Unfortunately both came w cucumber in them which he doesn't like. He ate them anyway but obviously did not enjoy them as much as he would have had they just been plain spicy tuna rolls like they should have been. My rolls were just ok.

The ""chicken wings"", that's how they were listed on the menu, we really good. They weren't wings, but cut up thighs. The sauce was really good as well. The table next to us had the burger and it looked really good as well. If you're in the area do yourself a favor and stop by and grab a great craft beer and some pretty incredible grub.",5

It was about 9 AM when we arrived, so they weren't full...but were much more busy when we left. I am SO glad the Coconut Pancakes are back on the menu. They were DELISH! Definitely one of my favorites! My husband ordered eggs, bacon, and wheat toast. His only complaint was that he forgot to order his bacon extra crispy (they use thick cut bacon and, if you don't order extra crispy, it can be a little underdone and greasy). Our server kept our coffee cups full. We will definitely go back if in the area again!",4
1151,"Zoey at the cashier area is super rude. There was almost no one in there and I had my hands full of stuff and she told me, very rudely, that I could not set down my items at the cashier area for a moment. I had four water bottles, so it did take up that much space. There was a sign there that said not to place items there, but I didn't see it as I had dark sunglasses on. All I had to do was pick up my chicken salad at the other area, which was already ordered, and walk right back over. There were two other customers in there, that's it, and plenty of room on the counter. I had tried to place my stuff way out of the way too. Any other customer would have had the entire counter space, but for my little corner at the opposite end, blocked by some cheese crackers anyway. It's just that she was so rude about it. I was in there awhile ago too, and same woman (Zoey) and same rudeness, only the last time I was in there there was no sign and no other customers. She's an middle-aged/ older woman (50's) with blonde hair, average build, raspy voice. There was just no reason she can't be polite. I was super nice and asked if I could set my water there quickly. I just hasn't seen the sign, but still... why be so rude? I think they should find someone else. 

The food is good, however. But I will now find someplace else to go when I'm in the area.",2
1152,"Was looking forward to trying a John Besh restaurant but wound up being so disappointed. Waited 15 minutes for a table, very reasonable since we had no reservations. Upon sitting greeted by one waiter, different one brought drinks, back to first waiter who took appetizer order, back to second waiter who took main meal order, 1st one brought condiments, second one meal. Never knowing who our waiter was resulted in poor service, bread was never brought until we noticed other tables had it and we requested ours. Now down to the food, sooooo underwhelming. We started with the Flamencuche, which they were praised for based on the framed news article when you entered the restaurant. It was compared in the news article to a good pizza, it was terrible, thin flat bread was overwhelmed with an insane amount of onions, its all I could taste. For our meal ordered the burgers, because all the reviews praised Luke's for this. Once again so much carmalized onions and bacon, it made it hard to taste the meat. This place simply was overpriced and under-delivered. Even on their sodas, 3.25 for a small glass bottle soda, ridiculous. So disappointed, didn't even care to see the dessert menu. Mr Besh, I was not impressed would never return.",2

Vegans stay home although their roasted veg side dish was great!!!!

1154,"What's up with your night? Well, why not grab a classic Tony Luke's Jersey-style cheesesteak and hit up the bar connected to the bowling alley. 

Bowling alley? Cheesesteak chain with a dive bar? Okay, I am cringing on the thought of how embarrassing that sounds for NJ, but regardless that's how the good old Garden State represents. I met up with my group of guys and gals, surrounded ourselves with our glorious looking cheesesteaks, filled up on drinks and sat around b/sing the night away at the bar. Aw, yeah! A laid back night with food and my buds.

At Tony's you can order cheesesteak (substitution chicken steak available), burgers, fries and your standard fried grab and go grub. My cheesesteak was served on a fresh roll, with American cheese that complimented the steak with fried mushrooms. With a handful of fries, it was all washed down with a cold one from the inside bar. Now, it wasn't by far the best cheesesteak I've had but right square dead in the middle of good and average.

Despite the sticky floor and fact that my shoes felt suctioned to the ground, service was decent. The cashier takes the order, lists your name and when they're ready it's announced on the loud speaker. The loud speaker shout out is clutch because there is no need to stand around awkwardly waiting. You are free to roam around and come or go. In the end, dinner is served and without ever paying a bridge toll to Philly's real Tony's.",3
1155,"Our last minute decision to try Asian Chef was based on reviews we read on Yelp.
We went as a family and reserved in advance. Upon our arrival we realized that the space was small but well furnished. This is not a tablecloth type of a restaurant. The staff was friendly and informative about their menu. The staff was able to provide a clear and concise description of what the raw material for each dish was and what the final dish would taste like. Their advice was accurate, beneficial and helpful. All the appetizers were delivered timely and were delicious. The main entrees were the same. The sushi was fresh and was made to our particular request. The portions were generous and well presented on new dishes with interesting designs. Our three issues with the establishment were 1) the establishment was understaffed  (wait staff).  We must reemphasize again the staff was timely and professional 2) hot food was served on cold dishes. 3) The website Asian Chef was small.

We highly recommend that you to try Asian Chef. Please remember that the Asian Chef is BYOB and thus you should come prepared with several selections to pair with this unique restaurant's menu. The menu choices are plentiful and run the gamut from Sushi to Spicy Vietnamese food.

Enjoy!",4
1156,"i have been here at least 6 times now and tried probably 60-70% of the items on the menu. I love tapas and have been waiting for a good tapas place in Nashville for a long time. My favorite items on the menu are the brussel spriouts, spicy couliflower, steak tacos and fish tacos. 

One of the things i appreciate is that they have tapas portions but also entre sized portions which makes it a great place for lunch as well.

Location of the restaurant and the parking lot behind the restaurant are also very convenient. 

Overall, I really love this place and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for tapas in Nashville.",5
1157,"Stopped in for dinner and the first thing we noticed is the bar with nothing on tap uhhh wtf they also sat three of us at a table for two. We had the nachos and empanadas and they were both delicious but the empanadas would be better paired with a cilantro type sauce than the remoulad it came with and the nachos were super crispy but lacked chicken.  For meals we had the gyro meatball which was a fail you just don't get a bite of meat with every bite and it lacked taziki. However, the chicken and waffles were good.For desert I had the Duncan Hines chocolate cake and it literally taste like box nothing to write home about. Final note the 2 $$ are not accurate it should easily be $$$",2
1158,"So, I've been craving tacos lately like crazy and it's super hard to find a taco place that caters to pescatarians in my area. After finding this place while doing a search for shrimp tacos, I decided to try it this evening with my family members. 

The restaurant is fast casual style, so you go up to the register and place your order either dine in or to go and if you're eating in, they give you a placard with a number to place on your table. 

I ordered the shrimp tacos, one tequila lime style and the other fried. My sister ordered a quesadilla, my brother the nachos and my boyfriend got the tequila like shrimp and fish taco. The food came out pretty quickly, we waited maybe 5 mins. 

I was a little nervous because I was super in the mood for tacos and did not want to be disappointed, and I really wasn't. The food was absolutely amazing! It was fresh and the flavors weren't so overpowering, which allowed me to really enjoy the shrimp. My family really enjoyed their meals too. 

Definitely coming back again when I'm craving a taco!",5
1159,"Way overpriced and extremely rude.  Tried to call for reservation several times and nobody answered.  Mentioned this to the person I assumed to be Angelo when he asked why we didn't have a reservation, and to which he scoffed at me as if I was lying.  I would have left if it weren't for the groupon we needed to use.  As we sat at the bar we meet five other couples that experienced the same issue and same rude attitude.  While we disagreed as to whether the place was more over priced than it was medicore and rude, we all agreed that we won't be bothered when this place goes under.",1
1160,"Drive the short distance from downtown to the Englewood area for a great cup of coffee (or latte for me)! Bonus, they have almond milk for the non-dairy drinkers. Can't wait to come back and try a Cuban or Media Noche sandwich for lunch or one of the bagel breakfast sandwiches!",5
1161,"A restaurant has to have a 'hook' these days, and one of Bailey's is the dairy/cow/rustic farm theme, right down to the milk can lights and assortment of old windows over the central community table in the bar area. The first floor is open to the second floor, lending itself to increased noise level, which it was the night we were there. Burger joints seem to be the ""in"" thing and this is a burger joint, but definitely an upscale one, both in their offerings and their prices. 

Another 'hook' is the option to have your burger made from a variety of sources: bison, lamb, beef, pork, chicken or veggie. All cooked to order and on your choice of bun. Some of their condiments were unfamiliar to our group (sriracho mayo, rooster sauce). All in all, an interesting concept. Our burgers were good, but we all agreed they didn't make it on our ""best ever"" list. And $11-$12 for a burger is pretty steep in my world - you're obviously paying for the concept & cutesy atmosphere rather than a well-executed burger. And when you add in drinks and dessert, it ends up being a pretty pricey night out, especially with a family.

Service was so-so. The hostesses seemed pre-occupied with their own conversation. Our server was friendly and answered all our questions about the menu, but she was pretty much MIA after she took our order. We didn't order dessert, and after reading other reviews, sounds like we missed out on the one thing Bailey's does exceptionally well.",3
1162,"The plates and cup were dirty coming on the table. The milk jug was extremely stained and my coffee cup was having brown residue all over. Coffee was bad, but that's OK. Turtle soup was very tasty, while redfish & friends was not that great! I don't think I would go back!",2
1163,You get what you pay for. Shrimp and vegetable tempura means you get 1 shrimp. Lol. Just FYI.,2
1164,Great location but the place is very tiny.   You sit arm to arm with your neighbors.  Food is ok and I love the view.,3
1165,"A welcomed and long overdue addition to Bridesburg! Smokey Pint is truly one of a kind, and not just for the neighborhood, but the city. First, let's talk food. Specializing in BBQ, all the food is created by the Oink and Moo food truck team. SP is offering a solid selection of the trucks staples, from quesadillas, to sliders, tacos, mac & cheese, ribs, and more! And the brisket is to die for, a must try! Then comes the beer. You can choose from a selection of 6 rotating drafts, or 3 full fridges full of bottled and canned beer. Mix and match to create your own six pack, drink it in, or both. SP is a must go if you live in the neighborhood, and definitely worth the trip from the city!",5
1166,"We had high hopes of this spot because of the photo I saw on Best Food New O Instagram page. Specifically, I came in for the Crawfish etouffee and grits(when I saw this photo, my mouth watered). I came in to try it but the grits were flavorless, even after adding cheese, salt and pepper. The etouffee itself was terrrrible; no flavor, no character, NOTHING. Worst dish I've EVER had in New O. 

When we asked how the grits were prepared, the server gave a spiel about grits being whatever you make them. Le No. That's why I'm here: for you to prepare them and wow me with culinary yumminess.

All in all, I will not return. There's so much potential with the dishes though, it made me sad.",2
1167,"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. they are disgusting! and i'm not meaning the food. the food is decent, but if you want to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable then this is the place for you. the whole entire place is TERRIBLY unprofessional. i'm 16, and even i am just appalled. they are all thugs. they are running the place into the ground. i watched them take a woman's register to put orders in, and put PORN IN. THEY HAD PORN ON THE POS SYSTEM, WITH KIDS AROUND TO SEE. i am completely amazed at how horrible this place is. for this bad of service, do not go here. even though the food isn't exceptionally terrible, it's still nothing you should spend money on. completely insane. i am begging you guys. DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS HERE. let alone yourself!",1
1168,"One of our favorite things when trying out a new place is to sit at the bar (when we don't have our kids), order a nice cocktail and pick a couple of appetizers to nibble on.

We were in town for a few days and stopped into Charro Steak to check it out.  We sat at the bar.  I ordered an ""El Maestro"" off their cocktail menu.  The bartender said they ran out of peppers (jalapenos?) and to choose something else.  I did.  The other drink was okay but I really wanted that spicy marg.  My wife liked her drink (with the upside-down Pacifico).

On their lunch menu, they have ""Mixtas!"" - which seemed exactly what we wanted:  tapas-style plates we could share.  I ordered three (for $7) and added steak.  The bartender wanted to charge a split-plate fee.  I have always been confused by this concept.  If a couple are sharing food and want to eat off the same plate, that should be okay.

So I ordered more mixtas so she put the order in on two plates.  All together we had the Chilaquilas, Esquites con Crema, Chile Verde Mac & Cheese and Spinach & Nopalitos en Crema.

The steak was good....but the rest of the food sounded way better on paper than it tasted.

So far my first experience here was ""meh"" but I would definitely like to come back and have a real dinner based on the other reviews and photos I have seen.

Oh one more thing:  the Charro Steak website has some issues (all browsers).  The upper menu has white text over a white background, so finding the menu (which also appears outdated) was a real treat :P",3
1169,"Overall a nice size venue and in a good spot, but, drinks are expensive and the security staff (a bunch of black guys and one chick) are something I won't write on here. I comped because it was an EDM event hosted by DJ/promotion groups that I work for.  It would of been $15/20, though.

 To start, the girl made me pour a whole drink out when I clearly just walked out another entrance with it to find somebody. My hand was stamped and I wasn't even wearing a jacket in 30 degree weather. Where else did I get it? Secondly, they threw friends out for no reason other than objecting the claims they did anything and even proceeded to beat the one up, going as far as biting him just because he shoved back for putting their hands on him.

Never coming back. Shame because it's a great place to dance and socialize.",2
1170,Great place :) Breakfast was delicious. Super nice atmosphere I will definitely come back :) Thanks David :),5
1171,"Absolutely perfect. The food is amazing, the staff is very nice, and the prices are great. Love the dinner and a movie deal. Perfect date for me and my wife.",5
1172,"Amazing food.  Great ambiance.  We had a little bit of everything.  Not gonna list all the stuff we tried. But everything was really good.  Small portions.  Hard to share. But every bite was worth it.  
Kushi oysters were on point. Probably my favorite dish.  Loved the habanero dropper. 
Caribbean seafood pot was my second favorite.  
You can go wrong here.  Awesome place and walking distance to the casino.",5
1173,"I like to enjoy a nice warm beer when I watch a comedian...NOT. The beer is always served with a hot glass. And the appetizers are really bad. I would come here more if the food wasn't so bad...especially since there is usually a two purchase minimum with the tickets we buy. I'd pay more for better food!

More to come on the comedy...",2
1174,Has to be one of the best cheese stake places in town.  Worth the trip.,4
1175,This pizza is really good! Probably the best pizza I have had in Florida. I just love their thin crust pizza. Yum!,4
1176,"Went because a friend ask me to meet her there. It lived up to all the bad reviews given. It was 7pm 3 people at the bar, bartender playing on her phone & talking to her friend at the end of the bar. No hello, can I get you something? After standing at the bar for a while she finally came over. I ordered a beer which she handed me unopened. I paid and walk to the table my friend and 3 others were sitting. At about 8pm 15 very young people walked in and had an even longer wait for her to even acknowledge there presence. I was guessing for Karaoke which doesn't start till 9pm. I left at 8:30pm. I have no idea how they stay in business and certainly don't know how she makes any money. Clearly the owner is not interested in making this a place to go. I went to the Old Double D many many years ago and I bet the original owner is glad he's gone-he should have never let them keep the name.",1
1177,"Interesting place with an interesting crowd given that I guess it's a speakeasy-ish kind of place, but that's why I like it. You've got your upholstered furnishings, paintings, and an aesthetic that fits right in with the other speakeasies in Center City. But the crowd is more Center City after-hours casual - that's not to say you can walk in with flip-flops or gymwear, but the general feel is that it's way less of a hassle to step in and enjoy a drink or few over the course of the night without having to endure long lines, cramped and dark waits.",4
1178,Finally a solution to the seagulls.  Great place to spend Sunday afternoon with the family.,5
1179,"My friends and I frequently go here for the trivia on Thursday nights. Food is always well-prepared and quite good.

I'd like to give some recommendations, though, about their trivia night.  The emcee stands in the bar area, which is always noisy.  Last night, she had to compete with music playing through speakers.  This made it increasingly difficult to hear and she had to repeat every question two/three times.  I suggest that the music be turned off during trivia questioning.  They could even turn it on while the emcee is marking everyone's answers.",3
1180,"The restaurant was very cute. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food that we had was good. Nothing overly special, but solid. We were perhaps disappointed because we had heard it was great.

Drinks were made with fresh ingredients and were very good.",3
1181,I loved the almond bun!! Sweet but not too sweet toasty and yummy!! The passion lemonade is awesome too! I like it better than the one from Starbucks!!! This is a must try place if you are at the mall!,5
1182,"Place is okay. They were the only restaurant that was able to accommodate a large party on such short notice. I ordered the black spaghetti that other patrons raved about. It was pretty disgusting. I'm not sure why he had some a weird texture and almost tasted like plastic. I've tried many different types of spaghetti and this by far was the worst plate I've tried. My co-workers said their food was okay though. Maybe it was just what I ordered that sucked. If I'm ever in Nashville again, I'd give them another go. The drinks were on point as expected.",3
1183,"We have been frequenting this place for many years but the experience we had this past week definitely will force me to NEVER eat here again. 

Typical Saturday night, parking lot was busy and inside was wall to wall people. Over the years I realized that while their sushi is great the service is pitiful. Waitresses work hard and are always friendly. However the hostesses are usually unfriendly and strike an attitude. I have confronted them a few times over the years but it never seemed to improved. Since there were only 2 of us they stuck us at a small table in the very back which was fine however we waited almost 20 minutes for someone to take our order. In matter of fact we had a bottle of wine with us and we almost got through a full glass before someone acknowledged us (I was able to get someone to open it for us).  

Sushi was good and we were offered desert but opted not to.  We were immediately presented the bill which we paid and figured we would finish the half glass of wine we each had before getting going. Seems harmless right??? WRONG!!!  Immediately after paying the bill the what seemed like a manager came over and asked us to leave because they had other people waiting for tables and they were busy.  I was pretty taken back by this and even the people sitting nearby who overhead the conversation seemed taken back by the comments.  I normally would throw a fit but I left. 

A few things to consider:

1. Sushi is way overpriced - so the fact that we spent good $$$ that night the least you could do is let me finish my wine.  You want to charge me NY prices in suburban Philadelphia - well act the part

2. If you had a problem with people sitting and sipping on their drinks then get a liquor license - it will easily alleviate your problem 

3. Yes the sushi is good but the service and attitude of the staff makes this place un-appetizing

4. Do yourself a favor and go into downtown Phila and find one of many great sushi places - Fat Salmon is one of my favorites 

5.  I know they have other locations in Montgomeryville and North Wales - not sure if their service is any better but if they are all owned by the same person this needs to be addressed 

To sum it up, I have never been asked to leave a restaurant in any circumstance so while the sushi is good I recommend that YOU SHOULD NOT EAT HERE!!",1
1184,"This is more like a 2.5 star review. My recent experience was pretty ""meh""...

I used to love this place when I lived down the street. I hadn't been in for a long time, and stopped in for a quick bite and glass of wine around happy hour time. I ordered a glass of wine, which was like $10. Not having a happy hour wine is really annoying, although they do offer a $20 bottle. Adding some glasses of wine to the happy hour menu would be cool. 

I ordered the pretzel with cheese. The pretzel was hard as a rock. So hard, in fact, that I couldn't cut it with a steak knife. I only ate about half because I was starving (it was 5pm and I hadn't eaten all day). Strangely enough, I feel like more than one employee saw me struggling to cut the damn pretzel, and no one asked me if everything was OK. Strange. I could have broken a window with that pretzel! Or a tooth!

Either way, it was a disappointing visit to a place I once loved.",3
1185,"Food was good. The A/C was broken. Where they sat us it smelled like an elderly persons diaper. We got to eat next to a dustpan filled with food trash. Two different people brought our food and they both forgot my side of ranch. Food quality was ok, like a poor mans in-n-out with the exception of higher prices.",2
1186,"Great hotel right on Bourbon St.  Craziness outside the door, sanctuary inside the door.  Remarkably quiet.  Only complaint is that the Internet is so bad -- completely unusable.  I upgraded to get the speed boost, but it is not worth it...  The connection is unstable and intermittent: page loads stall & time out.  Burning through the data on my phone instead.",3
1187,While the service was fast and everyone seemed friendly. My issue with this business is that while we were waiting to pay the person who I assume is the manager was berating an employee for not realizing a customer didn't pay for her ice cream. He was doing this while standing in front of the cash register. If you need to discuss something with your employees don't do it right in front of customers especially when you are being incredibly rude and over the top. Maybe if you had a better system in place instead of just assuming everyone around you knows what's going on this problem wouldn't happen.,3
1188,Really good food. As a group we tried a variety of things on the menu and were not disappointed by anything ordered. Only downside is its not the best place to dine in due to lack of space. Other than that it's great!,4
1189,"If you wandered in for a drink and stayed for some food, you'll do just fine. The calamari was particularly above average, and the ahi tuna nachos looked fantastic as they went by.

if you made a special trip to come here, you should maybe upgrade your Yelp skills. Service was well-meaning but not terrifically competent and the food was tasty, but about as interesting as you'd find at your average corporate hotel restaurant (though definitely better priced).",3
1190,Loved loved tippling place! It was my first time at a speakeasy and I loved the concept. Staff was super nice and the drinks were great. Will definitely return next time I'm in Philly.,4
1191,They send many jobs over seas to phillipines and india. Its hard to speak to anyone from usa.... Great service top of the line but cant see sending my hard earned American money over seas..... What a bummer....,1
1192,"This is the best Thai place around, hands down.  Sadly, I no longer live nearby. My husband and I got takeout from here weekly.  We never ate inside, but have been inside numerous times to pickup our food. It is located in a strip mall, however once you get inside it is beautifully and authentically decorated.  I actually am not quite sure why we never ate inside... 

I have eaten a variety of curries and noodle dishes here. We also occaisonally get the shrimp and pineapple fried rice, which is delicious. All of the vegetables are fresh and crisp in their sauces, no frozen and rethawed veggies here! In the curries with basil in them, it is actual strips of leaf, not dried and powdered, or even dried. This restaurant takes pride in their food and don't serve anything they wouldn't eat. We have also had some of the appetizers here, which tend toward deep-fat-fried chinese apps. Eh, I'd rather have an extra entree of their delicious specialties! My personal favorites are the Drunken Noodles, and yellow and massamun curries, medium--hot.   

I suspect the location is why there are more reviews for another, not-quite-as-good thai BYOB located on the main street, bridge street.  Between the two I would choose this place every single time. Better food, services, price and variety! Try it, I can almost guarantee you will like it... unless you are allergic to thai food.",5
1193,"My favorite weeknight Philly haunt!!! 
Where to start... I've had makeout sessions here, jumped out the window, nearly killed myself going down the steps to the wc, danced to the jukebox, fallen asleep in the back and of course... drunk and merry.

It's a typical Philly row-home-turned-irish-style-pub. There's a great fireplace in the back I've never seen lit, and around it are huge, heavy wooden bench seating around 4 massive tables. It's good for a big group. Smaller tables up front and more seating upstairs for proper dining. 

In the front part of the bar are two side windowledges which are perfect to perch on. Forewarning, ledge is about 7 feet from the ground, so if you jump out of them, don't do it in high heels. 

Good beer list though it seems to lack local brews. I'm not much of a beer drinker so it doesn't matter. They carry Pimm's!! The bartenders are fun. (Ask for Eileen by singing or screaming ""COME ON EILEEN!!!"" She loves that.)

Try the filet and goat cheese sliders. So delicious!!! Food here is much nicer than typical bar fare. The mac and cheese is freshly baked with a good sharp cheddar, there's goat cheese on more than just the sliders, the lamb shank looked delicious though I haven't had it. 

I wish they had outdoor seating. It was such a beautiful spring night the other night which is how i discovered prime window-ledge seating.",4
1194,"That's a shame! 
This place is full of junkies customers 
The staff and the service is fast 
It's just too much like homeless or you can tell the addict people all coming here and soliciting",3
1195,The regular pizza wasn't hot-n-ready we would've needed to wait 15-20min for 1 pizza that's crazy for a place that offers hot-n-ready pizza,2
1196,"Other than the non-parallel construction of the restaurant name, which annoyed my grammatically minded girlfriend, The Farm and Fisherman got everything right. 

The chef revises the menu every night based on what ingredients are fresh. All of the appetizers were tempting, but my girlfriend and I decided to start with a plate of mushrooms and a 24 hour roasted squash. The chef later told us that the mushrooms had been recently gathered by forager in rural Pennsylvania who had to sleep out in his car for two nights. The effort was worth it, we really enjoyed.

We shared a middle course of slow cooked tuna and then moved onto a steak and a chicken for our main course. Overall, the food was probably the best I have ever had in Philadelphia.

The restaurant is small, but manages to feel cozy rather than cramped. Assuming that I am able to get another reservation, I will be back.",5
1197,"Lovely chill spot to drink wine with meat and cheeses. Had a nice band playing. Enjoyed the ambiance, wine, and food! Will tell all my friends to go here when in NOLA!",5
1198,Been good other times ... This time was a total let down .. I think they are going through new ownership ... I will give them one more try but if it is anything like this meal we just had ... They will  not be open long .. It's sad,1
1199,"This is the worst bar experience I've ever had. I'll try to be brief. The three beers I tried to order last night were Sierra Nevada, Sweetwater 420, and Sam Adams Boston Lager. I drink these beers regularly draft and bottle and I am very familiar with them. 

I ordered a Sierra Nevada and it came out flat and warm. My friend ordered a Yazoo Pale Ale and received a cloudy, orange colored, spicy smelling blue moon. 

We sent them back and ordered Sweetwater 420 instead. They where also flat and warm.

The manager said their must be a problem with the draft system and offered us bottled beer instead. I ordered my standard choice of Sam Adams figuring it was a safe bet.

He returned  with a brown bottle with NO LABEL and quickly put it on the table without saying anything or apologizing and walked away. When I took a sip it was one of the same flat warm beers that came out of the draft, I couldn't quite identify it, but it wasn't Sam Adams. I realized that they had filled an empty bottle with Sam Adams. When I realized this bottle probably came out of the recycling I stood up an left. I'm still deciding if I'm going to call the Nashville Health Department on Monday. 
 
I understand mistakes happen, and so I was polite and patient with them. In return, I've never been more disrespected by any restaurant or bar. Any other place would have thanked me for pointing out the issue and taken care of it.",1
1200,"Pretty good for a breakfast joint. I'm difficult to please, thus the subpar rating. 

I was here on vacation. The food was exactly what it said it was. It wasn't going to knock your socks off but most breakfast places don't.  For the price and quality I think the Skyway Cafe is on point. Knowing what I do now about Skyway, I would go back.",3

I am not sure what asian villiage they raided to get all this stuff but they are selling it for very reasonable prices...still out of my range but hey.  Tables, benches, dressers and chairs are the most abundant here from china and thereabout to india.   Some american pieces were in the front room.  This wooden furniture is absolutely pristine shape I couldn't believe it and soooo much supposedly 90,000 sq ft of store on two floors.  Also rugophiles would be in heaven here a gigantic floor for ancient rugs or every sort and style is upstairs.  Next to the 'modern' super discount room with a bunch of ikea cheap style couches and chairs for around $100 or less.

1204,"Beetle under the basil in my Panang Curry.
Aroy Thai was my go-to Thai place even though I knew it had poor ratings each year on cleanliness.  I would tell myself well it tastes great and the customer area of the restaurant has nice atmosphere.  My husband and I picked up our standard order every Friday.

Well... Aroy Thai earned their poor ratings.  I ordered take out for two, Panang Curry and Pad Thai.  I got home and lifted the large basil leaf off of my curry and there it was, beetle.  I took it back.  They offered to refund the curry and give me a fresh order on the house.  But I no longer trusted that anything they serve up is sanitary so I took the refund and have not been back.  Folks, it tastes good but there's probably more to your tummy ache than spices.",1
1205,"BYOB, $10 corking fee. They accept credit card. Pretty sure its the same owner as Banana Leaf because both places are really similar. Large amount of seating and really big menu. Good mix of Malaysian, Chinese, and Thai. I think one of the most hyped things here is their Roti Canai, which reminds me of a really light Chinese pancake served with a curry for dipping. In addition, their tom yum soup is really solid, and offers a nice bit of spice for your meal. Chow Kueh Teow was like a seafood Chow Fun, and super tasty. Really great family-style restaurant. Fast seating and solid food.",4

We had 5 people sit ahead of us so I asked one of the waitress's how long it would be and she I don't know how long people are going to be sitting outside! Well that should have been out first indication of what service we were going to receive. Unfortunately our waitress was the same person who was rude at the door. Her name was Laura. Three different groups sat down after us and got their food way before us. When we finally received our food it was all cold. She did not come back ONE time to ask us if we wanted anything! We asked her for our check and she went back into the kitchen and started scraping plates and clearing other tables. Had to ask another waitress for our check who immediately got it for us. Very disappointed. This was our last day in Sand Key. We were looking forward to a nice breakfast to start the day. I gave them 2 stars because if the food would have been warm it would have been good. The breakfast casserole is recommended. Should have went with our first choice of the Wildflower Cafe.,2
1212,"I really can't say enough good things about this operation. After going on other fishing charters, the one main difference is this place REALLY knows what their doing! 

We went on a 5hr trip and it turned out to be an amazing day on the water. Came after a small cold front so the fishing wasn't the best, but the capitan and crew go out of their way to make sure you're having a good time. 

What I liked most about this boat is the amount of space you have. There's a lot of people on board, but the side areas are roomy, giving you enough room for someone to walk behind you while fishing, without you even noticing. And the air-conditioned gallery area! 

Over all, I gave this place 5 stars only because I couldn't give them 10 stars! I was extremely impressed, and I will no longer use any other charter boat. Hubbards Marina just got themselves a customer for life and I'm very happy about that. Not to mention, $55 for a day on the water... You can't beat it!

Btw, the hogfish we caught, tasted AMAZING!",5
1213,"We got takeout from here last night for dinner and I was really impressed! I've had Thai from a lot of the places around Brandon and typically I wind up disappointed.....most places aren't authentic and just really lack. This was not the case for Jasmine Thai. The main reason I took the star is because their crab rangoons were a bit dry. But my husband had the Chicken Basil and I had the Chicken Panang Curry and they were both wonderful. Also I must comment on the decor inside, they could use new carpeting but other than that it was one of the nicest Thai restaurants I've seen.",4
1214,"The food is good, but the service sucks!    It took them 15 minutes before anybody check on us.   Another 30 minutes before the food arrived.   Servers are rude!",2
1215,"My friend was in town for the last night before she flew back to Vietnam and she wanted an American meal.  What is more American than grilled cheese?  

She went with the Baja Melt and Tomato soup while I went for the Honey Apple and Corn Chowder.  Both soups were amazing.  The tomato soup may be the best I ever had.  

The sammies were ok.  Hers tasted like a quesadilla oddly enough. I guess that isn't odd since both are just vehicles for cheese.  Mine needed something.  Perhaps another cheese since the cheddar ended up pretty oily.  I know that is the nature of cheddar, but watching oil drip out of your sandwich is not appetizing.  

A glutton for dairy, my friend also ordered a chocolate milkshake, which was gross.  Just kidding, it was so good.

The staff was super friendly and more than welcoming.  They were playing the Muppets movie in the corner.  I know that I should have paid more attention to my friend as I won't see her for months, but it was the Muppets and she understood.",3
1216,"As a childless woman I wasn't sure how I was going to enjoy my experience here but I give the good folks at Chuck E Cheese credit....they do run a fairly tight ship. There are lots of staff running around both on the floors and behind the counters so whether you need to order another sample platter or get a refund after a machine ate your token you will never be stuck waiting too long. There is also staff at the door and they do stamp the kids to make sure they don't wander away on their own or with somebody they do not know.

I like that all the games here are just one token. There are also quite a few different types of games available from Arcade style to games of chance. One thing I did notice is that the game area is larger then the play area which means your kiddo's are more likely to want to spend their time here and your likely going to be reaching for your wallet on more then one occasion.

There was a decent amount of food sent to our birthday party table and even with six kids and five adults there was still pizza left over. I did find the birthday area to be a little crowded and we did on more then one instance accidentally back our chairs into people from the neighboring party table. 

The staff here were great and very attentive making sure all the special birthday rock stars were well looked after. I don't know how many times I would really need to come into a place like this as I don't have that many friends with kids but it was great to see them enjoying themselves as well as reliving some fond memories from my own trips to Chuck E Cheese as a little girl.",4
1217,"Service: Great. 

Burger: Perfect. I rate the burger at 8.5 which is pretty high for me (Higher than Shake Shack & Five Guys). The best in St Louis so far. 

Atmosphere: awesome if u like pop music. Good design. Decent place. 

Price: worth it. 

I'd definitely come back.",5
1218,"Alright so Starbucks is usually Starbucks in my book. Went in here after lunch, got through the line quick with friendly service. Coffee was hot, and they have coconut milk here. Things seemed business as usual and what you would expect walking into a Starbucks. 

Remember: if you have the Starbucks app, open it while your in line to make sure your signed in and not when you get to the register (like I did #fail).",4
1219,Went here 08/25/2017.  Over all rating is just OK.  Fries are on the sandwiches but they were cold and old.  Beer selection is mostly local type and server did not know much about any of them.  Food was underwhelming as was the entire experience.  Location is convenient but we dined outside and had two different people come to table and ask us for money when they were walking by the outside dining area.,2
1220,"Worst dominos experience. Placed an order that said it would be delivered in 15-30 minutes. 30 minutes after the order was placed, I received a call saying my food wouldn't be delivered for two hours. Cancelled my order and they said it'd be days before the money goes back to my card, I told them that's unacceptable, they hung up on me. Order at a better pizza place, Plainfield has plenty.",1
1221,"Though I'm personally not a huge Bud (or domestic beer for that matter) fan, there's not a lot you can complain about a free informative tour and free beer! And not just any 'ol bud but a variety of specialty beers that you can't find anywhere else. The clydesdales and dalmatians are the best part of the tour! Be sure to stop by their impressive gift shop to pick up some souvenirs.

Bottom line, when in Rome, do as the Roman's do, so when in St. Louis, make a stop off at Anheuser-Busch brewery and grab a bud like a good midwesterner ;)",5
1222,"First time eating at this restaurant. Service is fine, food is authentic, prices are somewhat reasonable. I just really didn't like that it is cash only. Step into the millennium.",2
1223,"Ricardo's is a great Italian restaurant in Lafayette Square.  For the quality of the food, the prices are extremely reasonable.  I'm not sure they offer any ""ground breaking"" Italian dishes but everything is very good.  I especially like their tortellini and house salads.  Portions are good.  Service is good.  It is a family owned place in a great location.  If you're looking for good Italian food that is reasonably priced, in a casual yet vibrant atmosphere in the city, I would definitely go to Ricardo's.",4
1224,"Awesome place! Cool vibe, open layout, great drink selection, really delicious and unique food. Only complaint is food is a bit pricey ($18+ for a burger ordered after waiting in line at a window??). But like I said, it's delicious. Bartender was knowledgeable and led me in the right direction based on what I typically like to drink, I discovered two new drinks that I LOVE.",4
1225,"Zero stars, this place is a train wreck. Not enough waiters and the food is terrible. Will be gone in less than a couple months. RIP Bagger #Fail",1
1226,As a local I can say by far they got the best of everything! Well seasoned and southern fried!! Seems like home when ya walk through the door! The red beans are the best I've ever had in my southern life!!!!,5
1227,"Sushi was good rice was a bit undercooked better than their Carson location but when we got seated by the host I let them know I was doing the dinner menu for lunch so I can have a full menu and also let the chef know and everything was great.... until I ordered dinner rolls I felt like I was being watched by the other chefs about the rolls I ordered and they kept going to talk to my chef in Spanish not knowing I spoke Spanish saying ""those are dinner only rolls"" in Spanish. I continued with my lunch but definitely didn't like being watched on what I was eating especially if they were speaking Spanish so I wouldn't understand that's not very professional and hopefully they learn from situations like this.",3
1228,I visited New Orleans this past weekend and visited Luke for the happy hour on Sunday. Oysters were 75 cents from 3-6 pm - woohoo! We ordered as many as we could handle. They were fresh and absolutely delicious. The service was excellent. Tip: sit at the bar during happy hour and get a vip view of the oysters being shuck. Loved this place and would definitely return - not just for the food but the service!,5
1229,"We went to Bailey's Range to have dessert with friends we haven't seen in years from different states. We came on a Thurs night and there was plenty of space to sit, but somewhat busy. We were a party of 11 with little ones. The hostess was super friendly at first and said she would get us a table right away but after we told her we were looking to have ice cream for dessert it took her close to 20 minutes and talking to the manager 2x to finally seat us at the empty very long ""community table"". Ice cream was average nothing special. The only saving grace of this experience was our waitress Alexandra who was super attentive and friendly. If it wasn't for her I would give this place 1 star, but because of her I would give this place another chance if I'm ever back in the area again. Has potential if the hostess and manager can get customer service concept down or be forthright and tell us plainly they don't serve large parties just for dessert so we don't waste our time next time.",3
1230,"Stopped in after a day at Adventure Island. The food was good, and they had fast friendly service. Counter service. No kids meals.",4
1231,"The trail is really nice and maintained. However, the bikers are rude and ignorant. I took my two children out for a nice stroll and received unnecessary comments to my children. One lady said Jesus F**kin Christ cause she was moving too slow for her liking, and had one of the Pinellas county people threaten me with a ticket for running along side of my daughter who was on a bike in the bike lane. He advised me to take my daughter who was on the bike to ride in the pedestrian lane as if that was more appropriate than me running next to her while she rides her bike in the bike lane. Either way it was the same concept. These people are a little too serious and need to slow down and enjoy the fresh air because they are nasty.",2
1232,"No stars. RUN from any thought of eating here. It has been at least three years since I was here for a very enjoyable meal. 

Last night I should have known things had gone downhill when I arrived on a Saturday night and only two tables were full. Twice we asked the waiter to turn the music down. We both ordered the special cream soup. It was literally cream with a bit of soup but generally tasty. The bread tasted and looked like a low cost soft wheat sandwich bread accompanied by a few moderately interesting relishes.

Then things went terribly wrong. I ordered the paella. THe dish arrived coated in what seemed like tomato paste right from the can. The shrimp was good. Everything else had a bad, and hopefully freezer-burn taste. It was inedible and I am a clean plate clubber with extreme tolerance. Since I have arrived home my entire digestive tract is in an uproar. The two employees, waiter and cook, were unmoved but did offer a free dessert.

After dinner I meekly and stupidly paid the bill. I went to the rest room to find that the plumbing was backed up. It was disgusting. DON'T WASTE A SUNDAY MORNING RECOVERING FROM THE EXPENSIVE MISTAKE THAT I MADE. The worse dining experience I can remember in decades.",1
1233,The bbq beans were very delicious. The Tri-Pi with the chimichurri was seasoned well.,3
1234,"Three things that are good about Jackson's:
1. Patio
2. Happy Hour
3. Good location for after work drinks

The food really isn't worth the calories or the money. Last time I visited I ordered the Rio Roll which my waitress told me was the most popular torrad. What it was: flavorless grilled chicken, bland probably pre-prepared guacamole, and watery flavorless diced tomatoes, wrapped in a crispy on the outside, gummy on the inside spinach tortilla. Delicious? Not really. The side salad was good with the champagne vinaigrette which was heavy on the vinegar. I've had the nachos and I wouldn't order them again. 

Why only three stars? It's not stellar. It's ""A-OK"". The 2 for 1 happy hour is nice and the location is a great starting point. I would just recommend whipping out your Yelp App if you start to get hungry.",3
1235,"I dined here recently at the suggestion of a friend. While the service was superb (Jill) the food was not. By mistake, I ordered the Key West grilled chicken, which was served with pineapple rice and vegetables. What I got were two overdone, but substantial, chicken breasts, a dollop of rice with ONE small piece of pineapple and some shaved zucchini / squash (the vegetable). No bread was offered or served. The owner may be a New York chef, but just being a ""New York chef"" doesn't mean guests will return if the food is inadequate.

My friend ordered scallops as entre ($27) and got 6 1/2 inch thick,,quarter sized scallops. To me, that seems like New York prices in a sleepy, beautiful Florida beach town. Doubt I will go back...but I hope they get their act together before others feel the same as I do.",2
1236,"The food wasn't hot, we ordered the ""El Jefe"" Nachos, both the shredded chicken and beef weren't hot, and the meat was dry....",2
1237,"So let me start out with the fact that the food at the Cake Bake Shop is delicious! It's a little pricey, but overall you get a great treat and the cakes taste amazing. However, I recently wanted to get our wedding cake there. We had sat down and did the tasting (it was $50), and decided the cake options were so good we wanted to have our wedding cake made there. The price was like $3K for 5 tiers. Since it was a gift we were not crazy about the price, but thought it was reasonable, and went with it. We had planned to pay them, but 2 days before the wedding we got bombarded with phone calls stating if we didn't pay by 9pm on Thursday, there would not be any cake for the wedding. At 10 minutes until 9pm I received a phone call stating that we had 10 minutes to get to the store to pay. I was running errands and stated I would be on my way to the person who was paying for the cake, and they could call in to pay. The manager called me a liar and and then called back and left a very rude message on my phone. We were able to call the next day to pay for the money (Friday before the Saturday wedding), and were told that no one is able to make a tiered cake in a day and that they weren't going to start on it or had started on it (we had put our deposit down already). We were told that we could purchase two single cakes like they make everyday, but nothing wedding related. I immediately called Taylor's Bakery and they were able to accommodate us and make us a gorgeous 3 tiered cake in a day for about $600. Everyone asked who made the cake after seeing and eating it, and loved it! Too bad it wasn't from the Cake Bake Shop! Lesson learned....just because it's expensive doesn't mean they have great hospitality or service.",2
1238,"I found Mom-Mom's food cart at a Night Market, and now they've opened a brick-and-mortar restaurant around the corner at 2551 Orthodox Street in Bridesburg! Score!

Sorry this is a bit of a bare bones review, but when I looked at the reviews and saw there was only one from 2018 and none so far for the restaurant, I felt like I had to get another recent one up. 

The food is delicious - flavorful and more complex than I expected. I wasn't raised in a Polish family, but friends who were say it's also very authentic. The pierogi dough is so soft and light it's almost like a crepe. The atmosphere is charming and homey, and the service is friendly, knowledgeable, and low-key. The vanilla-bourbon apple sauce is all I care about in the world from this point on. The kielbasy is from Czerw's down in Port Richmond and it is great - my partner's family has it for Christmas every year. I highly recommend the gołąbki - it's got some zing and, luckily for me, reheats beautifully since I totally over-ordered my first time here! Also I had never heard of pickle soup but now I want it all the time, especially when it's cold and rainy and I'm feeling under the weather. All of the bread they serve here - the long rolls, the dark rye - is excellent. Do yourself a favor and stop by this unpretentious BYOB gem.",5
1239,This place was really surprising.  The food was good and worth the money and while the location seems like a good idea it actually keeps me from going back when I do not have a need to be in that plaza.,3
1240,"Great pizza.  Very fresh tasting, but the environment is take it or leave it.  Very uncomfortable seating and nothing welcoming in the interior of this store.  I'm not stuffy; I prefer casual, so it's not that.  But I'd definitely get my pizza to go from here again because the veggie pizza is awesome.",4
1241,"This place is just plain too crowded every time I go. The food is pretty good. We've had some bad service issues twice where they brought all the food for everyone but skipped someone at the table. By the time they brought it, we were finished!",3
1242,"I have debated posting this review since Mother's Day ( month ago). I want to be fair, but gnawing at my gut is the overall poor food experience I had there. 

Of course I wanted something special for my mother on this day, so I gathered my siblings and their families and selected 3 places to attempt to get reservations. One was at the William Penn Inn, the other Route 6. I scoured the reviews and menus and decided Square 1682 was the best option. 

Square was super accommodating  with my large party of 12 and the customer service was outstanding. I canceled the reservation with the two other places and banked on Square delivering a great day. That was a mistake. 

Positive: The manager, staff, hostess, waitresses were super sweet. 

The mimosas were the best think i consumed that dining experience

Two  items were comped
 
Con's:
Two of our orders were mixed up ( another waitress took the ticket), so 10 of us ate while two of us watched. The late food arrived about 15 mins later. 

The prime rib sandwich was skimpy, grossly over cooked, and barely edible. I have had a LOT of prime rib in my life, this was thin and crunchy. It was served with a tiny bit of sauce on a firm fancy roll. My mother ordered the same and the disappointment on her face was awful. The others at the table had a variety of underwhelming dishes. No one was satisfied, but everyone was polite. I was crushed. 

There were a total of 5 mothers in that bunch and there was absolutely nothing special about it.  It was a nice room, the staff was nice, but it was one of the WORST dining experiences I have had in Philly.

I REALLY regret booking this place. We spent hundreds of dollars and everyone left a little quiet and disappointed. As a matter of fact my mother later confided she was STARVING after we left. 

I understand holiday restaurant service is maddening, but IMO this place was not properly staffed, nor prepared to handle providing good food on a special day. I would NEVER recommend someone come to this establishment. I wish I had chose one of the other places. 

Next year I'm #teamSomewhereElse! I don't mind paying the money, if I leave with a smile on my face. 

No smiley face here....",1
1243,"We use to dine at this restaurant quite a bit when they had a better loyalty program, and better food, price combo.  They seem to have made a lot of changes which aren't for the better in my opinion.  Service is horrible at this location, always seem to be short staffed and kitchen is very slow.  The Plenti loyalty program has weakened the value as food is way overpriced for quality.  Many better dining options closer to the mall.",2
1244,"Worst ever customer experience. OMI gosh. The fudge looked delicious and the pralines looked good and we wanted to try a piece. We were in line for over 15 minutes and I think which we should have just left like some others. We were being patient and thinking is kind of just the vibe. The woman who seemed like the manager running the register was so unprofessional it was almost a joke. She was talking with fellow employees and friends walking by more than servicing customers in front of us, which was only one couple mind you. When we finally got up to the front she's talking again to a friend and giving her money in front of us and then finally asks what we'd like by barely speaking to us and then proceeds to completely disregard us to speak again to a friend walking by. We left, obviously, so I can't comment on the fudge unfortunately.",1
1245,"This place would've been more had it not been for the attentionless server we were unfortunate enough to receive.

Having just driven a few hours in a car from FI/Brooklyn/etc when we arrived at this place the only thing I really wanted right away was a glass of water.  Looking around every table had water, so I didn't expect that I needed to order glasses of water.  Instead we ordered glasses of Cava and a few cheeses...  Our wine and cheese came, but no water.  I finally asked him for some. What is this, Europe?  And it's not like every other table there didn't have their own glasses of water, they did, and I doubt even that half of them had to ""order"" water. 

Didn't try much of the food, just cheese.  It was good.

Our server seemed like a nice guy.. to others.  To us we were lucky to get a word in other than to add to our order.  I don't know where his too cool for you attitude came from, I think he had us pegged as tourists as soon as we sat down.  Which we were.  But that doesn't make us idiots.",3
1246,"I finally got to come and experience brunch here! Which is easier said than done. I've attempted to come before and the wait was around 1.5-2 hours. 
On Sunday we came around 1115 for a 45 minute wait which wasn't bad for a group of 5. 
It's two for ones for Sunday brunch and I tried the sangria and the blood orange mimosa. I preferred the sangria hands down!
For food I ordered the huevos rancheros which was pretty good. My gf ordered the Singapore stiryfry and the white trash hash and I liked her stir fry a lot!
I will be back for sure because I keep hearing how good the tavern burger is and I won't make the mistake of not ordering it next time! 
Awesome atmosphere with a brunch of tvs. Can be a little loud though.",4
1247,"Sadly, Hobbs the Liger has passed away. 

Which leaves the bird display (sponsored by a local bird-fancier group) as the best attraction: the birds looked happy and entertained, sitting on their perches under the trees. 

As for the rest of the zoo....well, it's a roadside zoo. Small enclosures, some of them empty (maybe those animals died), some designed so it's hard to see the animals, missing, incorrect, and illegible informational signs, etc. I wish they had more information on the animals: where did they come from? How did the zoo acquire them? 

That said, the kids appeared to be enjoying the petting zoo, and I was pleased to see so many happy-looking teen-aged volunteers.",2
1248,"I'm only giving this place a one star for the convenience since it was next to my hotel.  I should have either saved my money or eaten at the gas station down the street!  I ordered the Asparagus soup with crab meat, green beans, and chicken salad wrap.  Well I couldn't even swallow one taste of the soup, yes I had to spit the mystery goo out. Tasted spoiled!!  The chicken salad had no flavor at all and was very dry. As I picked through it I found a lot fat. A total waste of money. The food ruined my appetite!!",1
1249,"Ate here for a month everyday on a business trip.

Beautiful food presentation.  Great taste.  Consistently excellent.

Will deliver to your hotel if you stay at the Staybridge Suites (which is best hotel choice in the area by the way)

All of the Outback take away servers were Warm, friendly, kind and professional.  They are always appreciative of your business and take the time to say thank you.  Feels like a family run institution at this Outback location even though it is a chain.",5
1250,I ordered the dragon phoenix it was my first time coming back to this place since 2008. I used to order from them almost everyday when I was pregnant. It only had 2 pieces of shrimp. I decied to give them one more try. the egg roll was good. The sauce was ok. but they do give you big piece of chicken. The one thing I do like ......... you can pick your own amount of sauces. They aren't cheap there .,3
1251,"Wow! No surprise w all the negative reviews. The staff here definitely needs better training. We went for simple passport photo, there wasnt any line but the girl Briana was rude, loud and seem piss about something lol. When theres other customer inline she ask them what do you want?

1252,"Our cabdriver from the airport told us last night to hit up The French Market for authentic Nawlins food. So we did. Walked around for a bit and saw this place. Pretty simple menu. I haven't had a po boy yet so I ordered the buffalo shrimp po boy, which came with fries and cole slaw. The folks behind the counter were very friendly. 

He po boy was amazing, granted I haven't had one before to compare it with. The shrimp was breaded just right, the bread was soft, and the hint of buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbs were perfect. 

The fries were breaded and seasoned just the way I liked it. Didn't have a chance to try the coleslaw because I think I forgot.",4
1253,"A nice little place next to their pizza shop. The Bronzino special was surprisingly tasty. I suspect this place is good for pizza and pasta with your wine. Casual and not noisy, and easy to get in and out if. Try the rice ball appetizer.",3
1254,"Just changed their hours to evenings only, 5 days a week.  As I was there to try the lunch menu I am pretty disappointed.",2
1255,"The worst body shop ever. They will blame you for their mistake. Don't go here if you have a Mercedes or BMW.

Honestly they did a good job on the paint but they are careless. They scratched up my leather seats, drain my battery, and my panels is not installed right.",1
1256,"Myself and a family member went into Table Talk to purchase a new living room table about a month ago, the table was one from reclaimed Indian Teak, and we were very excited about the table! After speaking to the owners, managers, and a few employees they loved the idea of the table. We got a great deal, paid the down, and waited the 4 weeks to hear back from them saying that our order was in and ready to be delivered.

Then the phone rang. It was the owner (I cannot remember his name, he was an older gentlemen), and told us that they couldnt get the base of the table, and wouldnt be able to put the table together. He said that they could still sell us the top of the table, but there would be no discount. We were rather confused about the request, and politely declined to purchase the table from them at that point. Back to the drawing board!

So, we did some research and found the table from their vendor through a friend who purchases wholesale furniture. The cost was the same that they charged us from the wholesale vendor, that Table Talk wanted to charge us! Now, that doesnt make much economic sense to us. 

In conclusion, we found it odd that they would 1. Lie to us, saying that they couldnt get the table, when they just mischarged us, 2. Attempted to scam us out of the difference in cash instead of just taking the loss on their business, and 3. That they would so disregard the common good practices of business. 

If you are looking for unique furniture, there are so many better places that have ethics and integrity. Avoid Table Talk at all costs!",1
1257,"Made a stop here one afternoon for an addition to my Hard Rock T-Shirt Collection. The t-shirts here are a little different in that the logo in the middle of the shirt is purple instead of yellow and it fades pretty badly after you wash it once.

I went to the food court and got something to eat and it was basically like you average mall food court. I looked around some and I thought that the casino itself was pretty nice but probably not as good as Vegas. If you are sensitive to cigarette smoke, I would stay out of here, this place reeks of it but that's to be expected in a casino in my opinion and it didn't bother me that much.

I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it did look like a good place to party, if I would have discovered this place ten years ago, I could have gotten into a lot of trouble here, LOL.",3
1258,The best Beignet's. Hands down. This great shop is located in the most lovely outdoor open air market. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. A couple New Yorkers were eating here when I walked by and their food got my attention. I had to take a seat and check things out for myself. Wow!! Do yourself a favor and find this place while in NOLA!,5
1259,"If the service was better this would be a 4 star review. The meal began with some rolls (Parker House style) that were boring.  The restaurant made butter, fortunately, was quite good and enlivened the bland rolls.   

The spring salad had a lively assortment of fresh greens served over a schmear of creme fraiche.  Too bad there was a little more so you could taste a ramp and such more than once.  The mackrel appetizer was very well prepared, seared on one side and served with juicy, sweet grapefruit.  That was a hit.  The one very annoying component of these two dishes was the ridiculously large plates on which they were served.  The plates would have been appropriate for a individual pizza, but not a small fistful of fresh greens. 

The ""mains"" of pork belly and loin with mustard greens and spaetzel, and hanger steak, were both excellently prepared.  The steak was perfectly seared and the vegetables crisp and delicious.  The spaetzel had an interesting flavor and provided a good texture to compliment the mustard greens.  Both of these dishes were spot on and demonstrated talent in the kitchen.",3
1260,"Great service! Our chef Augustus was funny and entertaining. He was super engaging and even showed us his dance moves! I feel like once you've been to one hibachi grill, then you've been to them all, but they're still yummy nonetheless. Good experience overall!",4
1261,"Allow me to begin. ... I love Mexican food.  Tonight's venture was for my daughter's 24th birthday.  Upon arrival, we were seated and we waited.  Way too long before service began.  The queso is melted velveeta.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla which looked like a mixture of chicken and cheese threwn up on a tortilla.Also we got two orders of bistek a la mexicana.  To say it was ""a la"" was an overstatement.  The steak was chewy and luke warm.    Everything was bland.  The best taste was the refried beans- out of a can I'm sure.  The staff were not friendly. When I told them it was my daughter's birthday, it was ignored - no smile,  no acknowledgments,  nothing.  I wasn't expecting anything free or singing but a smile and ""happy birthday"" would have been nice. The staff never introduced themselves,  left dirty dishes on the table. ... Overall it was the worst restaurant experience in my life.  I've been in more than a few countries and even when I had no idea what I was ordering,  I got better tasting food and service!   Both of my children and I have food poisoning as well.  Avoid this place.  Oh and the bill. ... $75. Complete garbage!  
As for the alcohol... my margarita was straight tequila (not usually a bad thing but not for 6.75 and in ice). It was a waste of my time and money.  Never again!",1
1262,"You know you can't really complain too much here, for $1.50 w/ student discount! I came here to watch Fast 6 and with the ticket price I wasn't expecting like a 5 star theater. If you don't mind too too much about quality and just want to see a movie for super cheap than this is the place for you. You still get a big screen to watch your movie and a movie theater atmosphere, but don't expect the cleanest/well run type of place. I'd continue to come here for cheap nights especially for movies that were not worth paying full price to see when they first come out.",3
1263,"I really like Ethiopian food and was excited to eat here when visiting Indianapolis.  Their food was good and similar in price to other Ethiopian restaurants that I've experienced, and the staff was very kind.  Unfortunately, service was VERY poor.  We came in around 3:00 on a Saturday so it wasn't very busy, but it took a really long time to order and then to get our bill.  Also, they only provided one roll of Injera per person and while they did replenish it, we were completely out for almost 15 minutes before we received more.  Our water glasses were consistently empty for 10-15 minutes (even when asking for refills) as well.  If I return to Indianapolis, I'll probably try a different Ethiopian restaurant.  It took almost 2 hours for our party of 5 to have lunch and pay which is just too long.",3
1264,"I really, really, really like so much about this hotel. For starters, it's BEAUTIFUL!!  Everytime I go to Reno, this is where I stay and I will continue to stay here when I go!!

PRO's:

1. The Spa is amazing! The staff working there are so friendly and helpful.The pools in the spa area are so clean. There were plenty of towels, water, juice, etc. 

2. The rooms were very clean and organized. 

3. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. We didnt like the location of our room, so they moved us to another location with no problems.

4. They have a little diner that is there open 24 hours and has good food. Granted its a bit expensive, but it's a casino, what do you expect?


CON's:

1. The bathrooms in the hotel rooms didnt have fans, so when you're in the shower it gets so steamy, so fast!

2. We ordered rooms services and we ordered coffee as well, and they didnt bring creamer.",4
1265,"After making a return visit here, I feel obligated to bump my review up to 5 stars, as Honey's has now claimed a spot in the brunch-loving corner of my heart.

I was tempted to order the Honey Cristo again since I liked it so much last time, but decided to try the Breakfast Quesadilla instead. It came stuffed with ham, cheese, and scrambled eggs, with avocado sour cream drizzled on top, and beans and pico de gallo on the side. The bulk of the quesadilla was the scrambled eggs, which I really liked, especially with the avocado sour cream adding a great kick of flavor. Would definitely get this again!

I also tried a little bit of my friend's Breakfast Bomb, which she ordered with chocolate chip pancakes instead of regular. The pancakes wrapped around scrambled eggs and ham were very, very yummy, and the chocolate chips were a great addition.

They also make excellent challah french toast. My other friend couldn't finish her Honey Cristo, so I happily ate the rest of her french toast for her.

In conclusion, a TL;DR list of stuff that Honey's does well:
1) Things with ham and eggs
2) Challah french toast
3) Portions that are actually finishable in one sitting and don't leave you feeling like you're about to explode afterwards",5
1266,"Have gotten a few cakes for birthdays and such well in fact several over the years. The last three have been less than yummy, this last one the cake it self was dry, very dry.

Guess it is time to find some place else huh.",2
1267,"Although I have yet to personally purchase anything from here, my boyfriend is a regular. This is basically THE place to go if you are in Tucson and own a VW. Those are always breaking down, and Chirco always has the parts or can find you the parts to fix just about anything. My boyfriend has a VW Rail and a '65 bug, so we are there a lot. Once a year in October they have Bugtoberfest which is a huge VW show that folks come from afar to be a part of. Really neat stuff, and usually some very rare cars will be there. They have a swapmeet around the back where you can pick up some cheap stuff, and also camping on the side for the out of towners. This is the show to go to if you are interested in purchasing an older VW.  If you talk to the guys at the store about things you are looking for, they will keep an eye out for things for you. My boyfriend recently got a great deal on paddle tires from one of the guys there.",4
1268,"I stopped in to Timpano with a friend for lunch on a Monday afternoon. I'd never dined at Timpano before, and was excited to sit down to lunch. I enjoyed the BLT salad. It was like a BLT and a caprese salad got together and made a very delicious baby. I don't know which part was my favorite: the house made mozzarella, the MAPLE CAJUN BACON slices, the fresh tomatoes, the arugula...it was a glorious combination. I officially want to make a return visit and try more of their menu because the food was delish. However, my one hesitation was the service on that day. Our waiter was very very nice, but we were one of maybe 4-5 tables eating lunch at that time (it was dead in there) and I think we were there for a little under 2 hours from start to finish. I'm all for a leisurely lunch, but seeing as I only ordered a salad and my buddy ordered soup/sandwich, I didn't see why everything took so darn long! We weren't in a big hurry so it wasn't a problem, and I would definitely like to return to try them out at dinner time!",3
1269,"Delivery driver didn't bring entire delivery, said he would go back to store to grab it and didn't return. Store refused to refund money!",1
1270,"This restaurant is such an experience. Live pianist, selective but fantastic and untraditional menu. Bottled drinks only. Excluding water. The down side is they are booked up and somehow we squeezed in. Visit time per dinner is 1.5 hours tops. They are always slam packed, for good reason! The art is super cute and it's in the perfect location! So travelers: make a reservation ahead. They turned so many people down. You don't get in without a reservation. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price for the amount of food. It's about $30-40 per person. I didn't feel it was quite worth that, but I'm from Texas. Everything is bigger in Texas! Would highly recommend !",4
1271,"I've come from Cali where boba is very common there. However I was thinking this place would have had the same feel. After being told this place branched off from California, I was disappointed. 

I'm more of a natural person. I enjoy real flavor, real fruits, and of course the perfect boba. I notice that some flavors were used by real fruits but others were just powder which I could definitely taste the different. Especially the taro flavor, being one of my favorites. 

But, if you're not too concern about natural vs powder flavor then this place could be good for you. They ask what level you would like you sweetness and any additional add-ons you would like. I always get boba but sometimes the grass jelly is pretty good too! I'd recommend you try. 

This is also a good place to catch up, talk, play board, card games and even do homework. I know it's always busy with students from the U of A and being told from them it's a nice area to just hang out, that's a pretty good sign. 

Maybe I'm just too picky, but I think it could be better. 

""See it, taste it, Yelp it""",3
1272,I am the one who had the half green tomatoes served on my salad and brought it to the attention of management. The menu listed egg on the salad and there was none. The manager comped my salad and apologized. The table where we were seated was on the corner of the restaurant and I ended up with the sun full in my face. A man seated in a booth behind me was having the same problem. I turned around and sat on the other side of my table but the sun was still shining into the side of my eye and was very uncomfortable. My son's tacos looked wonderful but were served cold so that was not a good experience either. I'm not too sure that we will be going back there again.,3
1273,Be careful when you take your kids in this place because a black kid punches my boy on the face without any reason and he's bigger than my boy. I told the employee about it and they didn't do anything about it.  Not a safe place if somebody trying to bully your kids. BE CAREFUL think twice going to this place...,1
1274,"Please do not waste your money.
You get exactly less than what you pay for.
Horrible service.
Rude employee
Messed up order without an apology or refund.
Nasty unscrambled eggs on top of one slice of cheese, hard bagel without butter and wrong meat.
Never again!",1
1275,"It looks pretty sure, but don't look fools deceive you. We came here to eat dinner and it took about 45 minutes to receive our food.
This restaurant was not worth the expensive price. 3 dishes for $65? Outrageous, the quantities were terrible, the service was terrible. Will never eat here again. The hostess was rude and tended to the only other customers in the room. She intentionally ignored us and our food came 45 minutes after the order. It was barely anything on the plate. he food was terrible and as apart of this culture, I could have cooked most of this food at home for under $10.
The quickest she came was to pick up the check, did not tip more than $5. No good service, no good tip.",1
1276,"I really wanted to like Urban Village but my visits left me slightly disappointed. It was very crowded because of the basketball. We quickly got seated but it was confusing because there were a lot of empty tables that for some reason we were not allowed to sit...(they didnt  seem reserved). 

Most importantly, we were not very impressed with the beers my first visit and the same holds for the second visit. My friend and I sampled all the of the beers and overall all the beers seemed unnecessarily bitter (I admit I am biased and am not in love with overtly bitter beers) and lacking in flavor. I don't think any of the beers tasted like the description listed. I did enjoy their malt whiskey beer (?) -- it actually tasted more like a mixed drink than a beer. All in all, the beers paled compared to nearby breweries like Evil Genius and St Benjamins.  

Their Rose pizza was delicious but the fries were left in the fryer for too long and not seasoned at all. Also, the beer cheese sauce addition was 2 dollars! which seemed like a bit much....",3
1277,"Don't expect to get any work done here.  Despite a lovely remodel of the bicycle store that was here, along with a good sized parking lot, there is quite literally not a single table in the entire joint with an electrical outlet.  No plugging in your phone, computer, nothing.  Sat here for tea (which was fine) for 20 minutes, didn't even unpack my stuff. I won't be back.",2
1278,"This hotel sucks! I gave it 1 star because I can't post my review if I don't give . I would give them damn minus 5 star!!! I was almost robbed by two guys in room 4086! I was screaming , kicked the door hardly, for a few mins, but nobody came to help. I couldn't believe those two guys were so crazy, how dare they!!!!!",1
1279,"Worth the effort to get here. Cool concept that offers a lot.  From the wine store on ground level with well-priced bottle selections, to the craft cocktails upstairs in the bar/dining area, everything was good and nicely presented.  The live jazz was fantastic on a stormy New Year's Day evening. Well- dressed good-looking crowd of 30-somethings. Surprisingly affordable, possibly due to lower real estate costs in this neighborhood. Easy parking. Cheap Uber ride from FQ.",5
1280,"This place was alright in my opinion, but not anything close to the best sushi I've ever had. The PCH roll was somewhat dry, and while the tuna sashimi and Caterpillar roll were pretty decent I've still tasted better. Ironically, the most disappointing part of the meal was the tea that my parents and I ordered. It tasted like water; absolutely no flavor whatsoever. As my dad said, ""This green tea tastes like water, and not even good water!"" Although the prices are cheaper, I'll probably hit up Arigato next time I'm in the mood for sushi just for the better quality.",3
1281,"This place is really good. Lots of variety, they had 3 different types of veggie burgers and a lot of topping options. I had Guadalupe (I think) and it was amazing as is, but even better with pickled jalapeño. Everything had lots of flavor! Be careful with the build your own burgers though, all the toppings and options can add up and get pricey. Your better off ordering one of the ones already on the menu. Overall really really good meal.",4
1282,The donair meat was very cheap tasting....like it came out of a can or something gross.   The place looks run down.  We won't be back.  People who think this is the best donair have lived a very sheltered life in the land of donairs!  This is probably one of my worst ones!,1
1283,"Yeah, good lobster but couldn't help walking away thinking I got ripped off.",3
1284,"Fancy! 

Surreal murals, chandeliers, all the great tacky wonderful stuff that casinos are made of. 

Many people will love this place and call it a five star! Hot hot hot tub, pool, lots of restaurants, clean clean clean, sparkly, great service, fancy spa, massages, etc. 

Just, a bit expensive IMO, and I HATE the expensive snacks left out on the counter to temp you. I prefer a more beat down casino hotel!",3
1285,Horrible experience. Pasta was gummy. Shrimp was overdone. Pizza was bland. Bacon had too much sauce.,1
1286,"Beautiful, tasteful and quaint. This b&b is paradise. The staff is friendly, the rooms are great and the entire experience is first class. If you want to experience some history and elegance this is a very nice place to stay.",5
1287,Once again I tried this place because my wife liked it. Semi good food but very poor service. Where do they get some of these waitresses? Our waitress with a long braided blonde ponytail could only walk by us flirting with another waiter. She never even asked us anything until we were ready to leave. Very disappointed once again!!!,1
1288,"Jasmine Thai has portion control sized dishes. In other words, they serve you how much you should really eat in a meal.Most Thai restaurants usually serve bigger sized dishes.This is not a bad thing, just wished I had a little more.It took awhile for someone to get our order but once our order was in, the food came out in 5 minutes. 
Their menu is not very big.Unfortunately they did not have any ""kid friendly"" dishes so our little one did not eat until after we left.I don't expect them to have mac 'n' cheese obviously, but you could easily fry some chicken pieces/strips in tempura or something. 
The bathrooms are clean and the hand carved table tops at the booths were beautiful. Our waitress was super nice.",3
1289,"I could write a lengthy review, persuasive and layered to hit all the right points. But why do that when Lee How Fook makes food that does it for you? Long story short they have some of the best general tso chicken I have eaten to date. Try it for yourself and get back at me. - Coolie",5
1290,"In the center of great bars and big hotels this place is perfect. $130.00 for the night, $30.00 tax plus $12.00 for over night parking across the street, $172.00 is cheap for a room.  Down there for a wedding reception, didn't feel like paying $250.00 for a room(going rate for all hotels in that area). Room was clean, modern, and big shower. Only down fall was no bathroom door (it's to the side in an out cove) and you cant control the air conditioning. Although the front desk was more than happy to drop the air down.If you need a place to crash, don't care about a pool, or hotel bar (tons of bars all over)this is the perfect place.",4
1291,"People just *talk* in the theatre, like there are no people around or a movie they paid to see on the screen. This happened *every time* we went, so now we just don't go. Management says they don't have enough money to have the staff to help the problem. Whatever. Deal with the children at Clearview or Elmwood. It's worth the drive.",2
1292,"It seems unfair to write a review after having been here only once, so I'll have to go back for round two sometime soon, but my initial impression is that this place is okay. It certainly wasn't bad, but it didn't blow me away. Perhaps I need to try something other than a plain croissant, but at the time what I really wanted was something lunch-like, and everything they had (as far as I could tell) had meat in it. Something vegetarian along the lines of their turkey sandwich and/or ham and cheese croissant (perhaps a spinach and feta croissant) would've been awesome. Maybe I needed to ask. 

In any event, it's a bustling little place and people obviously love it. But it seemed that you kind of needed to know what to order, since there wasn't a ton on display and there wasn't a list or anything. Next time I'll have to read the Yelp reviews and figure out what to ask for. :)",3
1293,"First time here . Great smoothies!!! Well done too. They have a great variety of smoothies. I think this is a place I'd comeback and we'll make me a smoothie fanatic. The persons working there were nice and cheerful. 
My only complain and deal breaker are floors were dirty with water standing on the room behind what seems to be a storage ( door was open). Also, The person preparing the smoothie washed his hands and dry them with his own t-shirt. 
I will recommend review this issues and present the store more appealing to consumers by following public health guidelines. 
Thanks!",3
1294,"Great food.  Our large party ordered basically one of every kind of dish from the menu: one curry, fried rice, noodles, salad, veggies, meat; plus a few apps.  All dishes were delish!  If you're looking for a good relaxing dinner this is the place to go.",5
1295,"This place sucks! The one up on oracle and wetmore is where I usually go, however, I moved and the university location is closer. Sorry Silver mine you have lost my business forever.

First, I ordered two sandwiches a large homesteak  with no green onions. I accidentally typed onions instead of peppers that come on the sandwich. These bozos still proceed to put the greens on it and the manager laughs it off like no big deal. 
Second, my hot homesteak sandwich was as cold as if had been sitting out for an hour. You guessed right it took an hour to get my food and then the hot sandwich was not wrapped in the proper wrapping to keep it warm.
Lastly, the employee got rude with me when I was checking to see what time my order would be done. He proceeded to scold me about how he only got it two minutes ago and it will be done when its done. Not how you talk to a customer buddy!

Goodbye Silver mine!",1
1296,"The quality of the food is great, but the service is horrible. In addition, I had an unpleasant experience on my last visit a couple of months ago and vowed not to go back. Picked up a carry out order after waiting well beyond when they said it would be ready. While at a stop light on my way home, I decided to vent the sesame chicken container to keep it from getting soggy. There was no sesame chicken in the bag. I drove back and they admitted they had given me the wrong order. There was a person sitting there and it was determined it was her food. They tried to get her to accept the food that I had taken from the restaurant and had been in my car! I would never want food that someone else had had in their possession and neither did she. She finally got them to agree to make her new food. Can't believe she even had to ask! Then, because they had charged me for the wrong order, they made me pay them the difference of $4.32 before giving me my food!! I'm sorry, but wasn't I the one inconvenienced by having to drive back? I was shocked they tried to collect. They lost a regular patron because of poor customer service. If it hadn't been so late and had there not been a household of starving people waiting to eat, I would have told them to keep their food and would have asked for a refund.",2
1297,"Wonderful family run restaurant, warm atmosphere and phenomenal food. The Tres Tacos were awesome and be sure to try the coconut cilantro rice. We will most definitely will be back. Thank you!",5
1298,"disappointing.

maybe i wouldn't have been disappointed if i hadn't been under the impression it was going to be more like a farmers market, not basically just a bunch of long lines to a bunch of lunch trucks. i got there late, thinking it goes until 10 and my friends inform me that if the food hasn't run out, then it'll be an hour wait for me. no thanks. 

it had a lot of potential to be cool, there was music and i saw a lot of people i knew. but there was nothing to do but stand in line or stand around.

meh.",2
1299,"Strong Pho game, but that's all that I have tried here.  

The meat portions could be a little bit bigger, but the broth is always plenty hot and everything seems fresh.

1300,"chicken sandwich was a little light on the jam and spinach, good portion of chicken.  Roll was great.  But really, .50 for a little side of mayo when 7 of us are ordering sandwiches and drinks?",3
1301,"Great breakfast place with affordable prices. I will have to come back and try the lunch selection. 

Be warned that on the weekends thereby be a considerable wait to get a table. Once you are seated the service is great and attentive. 

The omelet had great flavor and was a good sized portion. My boyfriend had the French toast and described it as ""melt in your mouth good"". It was optional to top it with fruit which he decided against this time. 

They have several tables that can accommodate larger parties (6-8) which was nice to see as well as a bar type counter if you were a small party of 1-2. 

Love seeing the local guy get the local business!",4
1302,"Pretty decent ice cream but lackluster food.  Got a tuna sandwich here online for pickup, and when I get there, they told me that they ""forgot"" to tell me that they don't have tuna in the restaurant tonight and can cook me something else.  So I was forced to choose another item on the menu of comparable price for them to cook.  I ended up with a grilled cheese which is teeny tiny and dry.  

Come here for Ice cream, but this place is definitely NOT ""more than just ice cream"".  All it really offers is ICE CREAM.",2

It's located in a strip mall, which made us a little leery at first, but it was all around an amazing experience. The service was awesome and the food was very underpriced for the quality and amount. Try the potato grouper... One of the best fish I've ever had. Oh! And they also have live music, an outdoor patio and a great burger special on Thursday nights. Cheers!",5
1307,"We arrived before doors opened for a show and the venue bar had BOGO draft beers which was awesome. They have quick bar service and a taco stand inside in case you need a bite to eat. We went to a pretty chill show but a small group of people decided this was a punk/mosh pit kind of show. They were moshing around, throwing beer on people, falling down, etc. Security was nowhere to be found. I tried talking to security and they were not interested in hearing from patrons.  Pretty disappointing after we traveled 3 hours to attend. Aside from the vibe, the sound, service, and bars were good.",3
1308,"Awefull!!!! 
If I could give zero or negative stars I would!
I've never wrote a review before, but I am going out of my way to say that I had the absolute worst dining experience at the Sake House!! 
And esp families, stay clear! 
So first off, I decided to take my 15 month old son out on a sushi date. We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a ""to go"" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say ""we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried."" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! 
Time that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.
I should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here. 
Don't waste your time or money!!!
Stay away! Any other place is better than here!",1
1309,"My favorite of the chinese takeout restaurants in my area (in terms of taste and quality). I like that they offer Pad Thai in addition to the usual Chinese fare.
Prices are on par with most other Chinese restaurants. The owner is super sweet. They have coupons regularly, no crazy good deals, but nice nonetheless.
No delivery, sadly, but food is usually done within 20 minutes.",5
1310,"This Starbucks location is usually crowded and the crowds usually mean you're in for a long wait, unfortunately. The drinks come out a little bit more slowly here, and it's tough to get a table. The layout works well, but the place is small, so there's not a lot of seating.

What I can say, though, is that I am usually waited on with a smile and a nice ""how are you today"" which makes the waiting suck a little less. Nice staff, long waits adds up to an A-OK in my book.",3

1312,Mister Car Wash may have cornered the car wash market in Tucson but the Price increase and poor car cleaning service speaks volumes.  Yes I did get a decent car wash for $27.00 after I did a walk around pointing out everything they missed. Windows/Door Jams/Bug Residue/Missed Water Spots how much due you have to pay to get a decent car wash without all the hassle. The old adage  if you want it done right do it yourself is were I guess I am headed with the limited choices for reasonably priced good quality car washes in Tucson. Spoke to Manager who said what doesn't come off in the wash is not their responsibility and could have cared less about my comments.,1
1313,I think capital beer is pretty ok to me. I dont have any complaints other than maybe price but that doesnt really bother me that much with this place. Ill go here once a week or anytime im craving sushi its always pretty good. Chinese food is standard. Great beer selection take your pick.,4
1314,"Where do I start. I ordered food to go it was my first time here so I ordered the Blue Jawn  burger no lie  I vomited we had to hurry up and pull over. I ordered the general tso chicken tacos not good and the sauce was too sweet. They were using bare hands to prepare the food which was already a turn off. The place is small and tight everything is everywhere. My 3 year old daughter brung me spray bottles I guess they had in her sight. The Mac and cheese were like baby elbow and partially hard . Looks are very deceiving, everything looks good but I wasn't happy.My baby didn't even like her Mac and she love Mac and cheese and my son love General tso chicken but not this one. I will not be returning ever. The prices were very high too.The food was being prepared or put together after food was cooked at least when a pizza goes in the oven  and bake it kills the germs.You'll do everything bare hands before cook and after and I have the pic of that too I can post it. No sarcasm needed. Thank you Nick. No everything wasn't as quack up to be",2
1315,"I saw a sign that said free for kids on Monday. This was false advertising cause they only have this promotion in the fall. 

Can't complain about the food or service. Fast and very friendly. Chose seating outside, the view of the fountain was beautiful. 

My only complaint was how god awful the bathroom was. Not only was it old and very outdated. It was filthy. In my stall someone smeared their feces on the wall. 

I think management has to do a better job of maintaining the facility a little bit better.",2
1316,"I LOVE this place! I am from Chicago, and visit the area sometimes a few months out of the year. This is my go-to place for produce when I dont go to local farms. Everything here is usually locally grown and LUSCIOUS! Excellent quality of produce, and I am very picky! Not only do they have a beautiful selection of veggies and fruit, there are  also a few homemade goodies (breads, cookies, honey etc) that are pretty dang good too! All that greatness that doesnt bust the bank, what more could you ask for?

EDIT: I am very angry at YELP for not filtering the right reviews. This produce stand deserves a 5 start rating, it is just that good. Produce here isnt labeled as organic, but a lot of the stuff is local, and a lot of farmers around here use integrated pest management. no farm wants to pay for the silly label of 'organic' and i dont blame them.... the government should NOT be taking a cut when we are trying to live and eat as we were meant to. Also, the produce here is not all huge and mutant like a lot of GMO i see at the grocery store... i wouldnt worry too much about that.",5
1317,"I went in to have my battery replaced for my car, and the sales person who helped me initially was very kind and helpful, however after waiting for almost 35 minutes in the back waiting room (for a supposedly 15 minute oil change), I came out to find out what was going on only to see my car parked in the parking lot.  When I asked if my car was ready, the employees didn't know.  Finally they found out it was ready.  No one apologized for leaving me sitting waiting for more than double the time it was supposed to take.  I wouldn't recommend going here due to the employees lack of concern and poor service.",2
1318,"Service was fast.  There's a full bar.  My wife had their Summertime Gimlet based on cumber infused gin.  Very nice, but pricey for a cocktail.  On tap beers weren't that good.  

The prices were high for bbq on a metal platter.  My wife & I both had bbq sandwiches.  The rolls were a bit dry and on the small side for the price.  Meat was good, but again the sandwich was smaller than I'd expected.  The sweet potato fries were plentiful and tasty.  My wife didn't care for the cole slaw.  The beans were good, but skimpy.  I liked the sweet potato and pecans.  We split a blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  Great ice cream, OK cobbler.  It was fresh baked and large, but needed some more sweetness.

The atmosphere was nice.  Downstairs music was just starting up.  Judging by the full parking when we left the place was probably rock'in later on.",2
1319,This place is like a fancy Subway.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The clam chowder was a 3 out of 5.  I also had the turkey bacon avocado sandwich.  It was a 2.  Very bland and I think the tomatoes were old.  I did like the chocolate strawberry.  It was a nice surprise..,3
1320,"I gave The Mason Jar 3 stars for these reasons: 

-They always get to-go orders incorrect. Always. 
-The front of the house staff is not welcoming. They are sort of dreary. 
-The menu is ok. Not a lot of diversity in the menu here. Standard American cuisine. 

I do love the burgers however, and those dang garlic fries get me everytime! They are great for sharing.",3
1321,"This place is a disaster in slow motion.  I would avoid this place like the plague.  Most mornings the drive-thru service is so backed up it blocks traffic on Bloomingdale.  The traffic pattern within the property where the location sits is horrible.  Also the service, while my expectations are not high, is extremely slow and often incorrect.

This location is also not owned or operated by Dunkin corporate either, so if you have a problem that management does not resolve at this location, no one at corporate can do anything for you, you are just SOL.

I won't even go here to buy my beans anymore they have messed up that much, DD does have great coffee, but this place can mess that up to and has.  Bad management, no pride of work, and just not worth the time and money.",1
1322,"My wife and I were looking for a local bakery while we were in New Olreans and thanks to the power of technology we were able to find this cute bakery with in walking distance of the Blake Hotel where we were staying for the week.  The walk down to Bittersweet Confections, was a nice one...too bad the rain made us rush a little.  

But now to the meat and potatoes of this review.  When I think of a cupcakery, this is the quintessential idea of what it should look like.  It had a warm inviting feel that made you want to sit down and chat with friends for hours.  It doesn't have that stale feel like a big chain bakery.  Excited that we found a place like this, we ordered way more than we should have...but there was so much good stuff how could you not!  We did 2 cupcakes, I had the breakfast bowl, my wife had the vegetarian Quiche, and I also had a cup of their Bittersweet Mocha.  The food was amazing!  It was a much better option to eat here than some of the tourist places that had constant lines in them.  

 - The breakfast bowl was a hearty mix of a biscuit, grits, egg, cheese, and bacon.  
 - The quiche was a light fluffy consistency with big chunks of veggies.  
 - The bittersweet mocha was not exactly my style of coffee, so I added a little caramel and it was fantastic.
 - German chocolate cupcake and salted caramel cupcake both had a nice texture and flavor, but my wife and I both preferred the German Chocolate over the Caramel.

At first I thought the prices were a little high, but in retrospect it was under most of the meals we had in the area and we walked out much happier because we weren't fighting for a place to sit.  I would definitely go back.",4
1323,"I love it here. The nachos are by my favorite thing here. The food is always good. The burgers are great. The beer selection is nice too. If you are going during the weekend dinner rush, get a reservation.",5
1324,"The dancing bonito flakes are a lovely effect as the sizzling takoyaki make them sway. Take a second to soak in the presentation. No but really take a second. Don't be like impatient me who bites into molten takoyaki, disregarding all warnings and good sense! I knew better, but I do these things constantly with pizza slices, and with delicious Japanese street food snacks, evidently.

I am a fan of Maru's savory ping pong-ball-sized pancakes, filled with pickled red ginger, scallions and octopus. Takoyaki, handmade while you wait, eight of them are served up nice and hot... A golden steamin plate of takoyaki, covered in shavings of dried bonito, nori, a drizzle of tonkatsu sauce. It's a really great snack, and you know I love a little nosh to share ""on the way"" here or there. I need incentives and rewards for everything. The spicy octopus variety with a little shichimi mayo fits the bill quite nicely.

Also, after peering at the Maru ball cooking process, I am sure that I now really want a nice cast iron takoyaki pan for my very own, to add to my stockpile of kitchen paraphernalia. In addition, just want to note that I love Maru Global's red lanterns with the cute octopus fella on em... My house needs some of those too, because I can't stop hanging decorations from my ceiling. I can not stop.

A really nice couple run this very tiny shop of wonderful authentic Japanese bites. I'll be back and back and back.",4
1325,"An above-average burger with a nice selection of fresh toppings. Fries are tasty as well. The patties are on the small side, which I actually prefer sometimes, but it does necessitate either getting a double or two singles to feel full. Staff has always been friendly to me and the food comes out very quickly.

If you want a burger and would normally just grab fast food, this is well worth a couple more bucks a couple extra minutes.",3
1326,"Excellent place! We had Crab Cakes and Crab legs for our appetizer. Then we had Taste of the Baypu, little of everything....so delicious and fresh!",5
1327,This McDonald's is by far the worst one I've ever encountered I ordered two apple pies and noticed that the use by date wasn't anywhere near today's date 3/4/16 and when I said something to the employees about it the answer was someone must have printed the dates wrong all the apple pies have that date and I was wrong and disrespected I felt so degraded by the people who work for this establishment I will never go there again I'd rather drive across the bridge and pay the toll to go to Philadelphia and order from another McDonald's then ever go to this location again I hope they retrain the employees who work there. And they want $15.00 an hour,1
1328,"This is the best Barber shop in the city. 

If you've been to Aidan Gil in the last 7 years, chances are you got your hair cut by one of these barbers. Sarah, Nate, and Mike have been delivering the freshest haircuts to Aidan Gil customers for the better part of a decade, and now they have their own shop. They are all great barbers and great people. 

The atmosphere is light and fun, it's like you're getting your haircut in your friend's living room. The haircuts are always on point, the fades tight, and the shaves close. 

Go in, get a drink, relax and watch some TV while you wait, refill your drink and enjoy your cut/shave.",5
1329,I was not pleased with this restaurant at all. The service was slow. The cole slaw was rotten and slimy. My husband took a bite and had to spit out. Told the waitress and she said that it was for garnish not consumption. Talked to another person that asked how things were and she said that she tasted it and nothing wrong. I just hope no one got sick. They were not willing to offer anything else except the same slaw that was rotten. I will never go back to this restaurant again.,1
1330,"A 'safe choice' for foodies and dates. Went here for a smaller celebratory dinner date to do the tasting on a Thursday night. 

Pretty nice atmosphere, and we had a great time for dinner. I don't remember being too crazy-impressed with the food, but like I said, a 'safe' choice. Surprisingly, the food that sticks out to me the most was the foie gras soup. Despite not being the hugest foie-gras fan, I must say that it was delicious! 

Price-wise, very decent for the tasting menu. I guess I was expecting a bit more (food-wise), but it was overall a nice experience.",4
1331,"This is mainly for the cashier that helped me out yesterday. I came into the store knowing that the whole place was on sale because they're closing (along with the other Sports Authority stores in town). They had a lot of apparel to look through, so I spent quite a bit of time there. Anyways, there was one point when I needed someone to unlock the fitting room door, so I approached the two guys at the cash register. A bald Caucasian man, with a beard, helped me out and seemed pretty friendly. The cashier, young Caucasian college or late high school-aged guy, was the one that bugged me. He used words that made him sound ""nice,"" but you could tell he was half-assing what he said and did. That has been bugging me. I question how he got hired in the first place, but I did see that they're hiring temporary employees. Please, do us all a favor and work somewhere that you enjoy being at more....come on, why choose something involving customer service if you can't even provide good customer service? Sure, minimum wage may stink (I'd know), but someone else may be happy to take the job.",2
1332,"I've been staying at the Alexander on business for the past 12 weeks. Every aspect of the stay was great, especially the staff and food at the Market Table breakfast, up until the very end. 

My company covered the cost of parking in the garage for the first few nights. After which, we could either park across the street or pay out of pocket to continue parking in the garage. I elected to remain in the garage. Apparently, the monthly garage parking fees cannot be pro-rated. Meaning if you stay in the garage May 31st through July 1st you are going to be charged for 3 months, rather than the 1 month you actually stayed there. My situation was similar. My company covered the costs up until May 30th, and I parked in the garage May 31st through mid-August. So, to my surprise, as I was preparing to check out, I was slapped with a $700 ($175/month) parking bill. Despite the fact I elected to be billed monthly. I didn't even try to dispute the last 2 weeks of August that I'm being charged for. But charging a full month for 1 day in May, where is the customer service aspect in that? Especially considering my vehicle was broken into and cost me upwards of $800 to get the window repaired and replace the lost items. To add insult to injury, I was told on two separate occasions that due to my misfortune in their garage (the break in) they would take care of the parking fee for me. Which would have been an incredible act of good faith. However, I guess the staff wasn't on the same page, because I still ended up paying the whole amount.

As I said, outside of this situation, the staff and service were amazing. But I think it's incredibly distasteful to do what they did at the very end. Talk about leaving a bad taste in your mouth.",2
1333,"I am incredibly satisfied with the work they did. Tim listened to my concerns about our SUV's temp gauge and gave me information that helped me make a decision. Never once did I feel like I was pressured into anything. Professional, all the way. I really appreciate the integrity these guys demonstrated. Big ups to the mechanic Mike for A+ work.

If you can, try to schedule an appointment in advance. There's a steady flow of walk-in customers.",5
1334,Do not waste your time ordering take out.  Ive waited over an hour and received the wrong order twice now.  This place stinks!,1
1335,"You will wait at least over 30 minutes in the drive thru! Go to ANY other Taco Bell and you wont! I have tried several times through the years and it never fails! They don't care about how long you wait! Wasn't even offered a apology for the wait! I asked why in the world is always so long of a wait here? Brooke just shrugged her shoulders and said,"" we are just short handed.."" which seems to always be the case! I wish they would just shut it down! Worse service ever! Laughing and flirting with other employees at the window! Never ever go here again!",1
1336,"I used to come here quite often, my father did the interior construction before they opened and Michael always cooked us a great meal. That was years ago. Since I've moved back to Tampa, thought I would stop in for lunch with friends. Michaels Grill has changed and it is HORRIBLE! The lunch menu is just sandwiches and salads, blah! The Service was awful! There were 3 empty tables outside and it was beautiful outside, but we couldn't sit there, they were reserved. So we had to wait for a table, even though there was a table open that seated 6, we were a group of four. They wouldn't let us sit there. While we were waiting for the table to be cleaned, a group of 3 came in and the hostess sat them at the table for 6!!! WTF!!! We finally sat down and ordered right away. We waited a very long time to get our food, the group of 3 at the 6 table got their food quickly, and so did a couple of tables who ordered after us! When the food finally came, they gave me the wrong quiche. I ordered the special, florentine. The waitress didn't notice that it was not what I ordered and went to fix it, but then she said they were out of the special. I looked over at a few of the tables that got their food before us, and ordered after us, they had 3 slices of Florentine quiche. Again WTF!!!! So then I asked why they were able to get what they ordered, when we ordered before them... She just said that our table had a sandwich that took longer than theirs! Really! So I just kept the shecrab soup. Which use to be amazing, but now it has a gravy consistency! Yuck! We were all very disappointed with the service! And the food is not up to par like it used to be. My friends thought the sandwich and salad were not high quality and definitely not worth the $$$. Sorry Michael, but you should just close lunch service or fix it!",1
1337,"This was an excellent BEEFivore experience and that was exactly what I was looking for.  I blew in here for lunch after an aborted jury duty experience.  

My first impression was IMMACULATE.  This place was spotless!  In the men's bathroom I swear you could eat off the floor.  I didn't check the ladies room as I didn't want to deal with the yelling and screaming that would ensue.  A place this clean is a good thing. 

The ATMOSPHERE here is pure classic pub.  Lots of beautifully finished dark wood and slightly dim lighting.  The bar is very nice with about 15 seats and a few high-tops near it.  I loved it.

I ordered Beef Barley soup ($6) and a Roast Beef sandwich ($6.50). I added sharp provolone for $.75.  My soup was hearty and delicious and served at the correct temperature so I could enjoy it right away.  I hate it when the soup is so hot you just have to stare at it and wait for it to cool.

If you are a roast beef sandwich aficionado there are two things that might surprise you here.  First, this sandwich is served with rich brown gravy not au jus.  Second, if you pay your $.75 for sharp provolone, and you should, it's served on the side.  I don't know if you can tell from my pic but that was a lot of cheese.  Way more than you would normally get on a sandwich.   BTW- This was one delicious sandwich!

These folks are coming up on their one year anniversary.  I hope they stick around.  I'll help out by coming back for sure.",4
1338,"The food is mediocre for the prices. Also the hostess tried to sit us in the bar area with five people and a handicap person.  I asked her if we could get something else she said no this is where the next waitress needs a table. What?????
So I was about to get the manger and she decided to move us. Their patio is not pet friendly which stinks and do not get the veggie burger it is horrible. They used to have a better one not sure why they changed it. Also please get some dairy free cheese cakes already, it's 2016!


Update: Veggie burger is much better now!",2
1339,Best Thai we've had in the area. The staff is extremely kind and the food is great. We live near and eat here 2-3 times a month. The specials are definitely worth checking out. Still trying different curries,4
1340,Finding out that your home will need new drainage fields installed is never a good thing to hear however Jim and his crew were easy to deal with and got the job done right. I would highly recommend Cote's for your septic needs.,5
1341,"Horrible  experience .
We been there yesterday with some friends.
Long time waiting, costumer reclaim for food never come to the table,somebody ask  for pizza they just forget including in the order and when they bring to table was no ready.
We order milanese steak wao!!!!! Extremely overcook you cant even cutting ,beans come to the table late and the banana plantain was just ridiculous. 
We choose this place yesterday
 but am not recommended  to nobody.",1

Excellent food. The cod and Brussel sprouts are amazing.",5
1343,"We FINALLY made it to the Body Worlds Exhibit last night for what was our very first experience at the Telus World of Science.

First things first, if you can get here before this exhibit moves on, it is absolutely worth it!  What an incredible view into the fragile yet oh-so-powerful body that each of us inhabits?!?! While it is a very graphic exhibit (Insert disclaimer here)  I marveled at the  things to see, the fantastically fun facts, and the intricacies of how our many parts work together!  

So now on to the museum itself: while the Body Worlds Exhibit caters to an older crowd - there are plenty of other exhibits where I found myself wishing we'd brought a ten-year old along to TRULY appreciate the experience. We enjoyed the hands-on weather stations where we created a tornado. We loved looking at the tropical fish. And we appreciated the artifacts and photos detailing the history of law enforcement officials. While we're far from being ten-years-old, there was plenty to see and to interact with!  The best part for us, is that on a Friday night at approximately 8:30, there weren't any school field trips and for the most part the exhibits were quiet.  

Although we absolutely enjoyed our visit, and may go back for free entry to the observatory, the entry fee of $26.00 per adult means we'll be finding something else to do next weekend.",4
1344,"I liked this place because the service was great and the food was on par with what I expect soul food to taste like. I liked the mac and cheese, chicken, and red beans&rice.",4
1345,I really like this Petsmart - although it is definitely on the more expensive side.  They have a great selection of items and the shelves are always stocked well.  I take my dogs to this location for their grooming and they've always done an amazing job with them.  The few concerns about the store is it's really not laid out very well for the amount of foot traffic they receive and there never seems to be enough help at the cash registers.  Even with those issues though I'll definitely be back.,4
1346,Shout out to the Peanut Butter Cookie Cream Pie shake bro. That's what I am talking about. So simple...so good. I'd get that again and again.,4
1347,"Sister restaurant to Cantina Feliz, same menu.  Service was average but very pleasant.  The environment was lacking.  Music bounced between rock and Mexican themes which was odd.  But the food was solid.",3
1348,"Best Sushi I have ever had. I don't know if i would just call it sushi, because it's so much more. I would consider myself a sushi connoisseur, lived in Japan for two years, had sushi in San Fran, San Diego, LA, Florida, and all over. I know a lot of people complain and say this isn't ""traditional sushi"" like they actually know what they are talking about. So i'll tell you, traditional sushi is plain fish on rice or a roll with one fish in it. There is only so far you can go with flavor when dealing with a piece of fish with no sauce on it. Americanized sushi tastes so much better....period. 
      At Sakana my girlfriend and I got the Pink Bear roll (amazing, made love to my taste buds), the Garlic Albacore (melts in your mouth, delicious), habanero yellowtail belly (still in amazement), Lobster Melt roll (filling but so much flavor its like a flavor bomb went off in your mouth). The last roll wasn't my favorite and my girlfriend didn't really like it, it was the blue fin specialty roll they had.
      This place has really good sauce-sushi combinations, and I love spicy so this was right up my alley. My girlfriend and I are going back again for our second day in a row. As for price, we got all of this for $59 so it was actually cheaper than I expected it to be.",5
1349,"Great Indian food! We received a basket of crispy crackers with four different chutneys to try as well as complimentary red pepper soup prior to our meal. My mango lassi was the perfect level of sweet and refreshing. My friend and I shared the palak paneer (and I'm looking forward to the leftovers tonight!) and the chicken shahi korma, a dish that was new to both of us...and there were no leftovers of that! It was wonderful. Both dishes were served with a side of basmati rice, and the attentive waiter offered to bring us more if we'd like. Excellent food, great value! I can't wait to try out the lunch buffet one day.",5
1350,"Great place for a good, hearty meal. Visited Mena's while on vacation in new Orleans and was one of the best places we found to eat. Highly recommended is you want good food at a good price with great service.",4

1352,"I live in NW, like to pick up sandwiches when we go hiking. Second visit here. 3 young ladies with very poor customer service working. Was the same at our first visit, plus they got our order all wrong then. Think I'll drive the further distance to Deli Town where both the customer service and sandwiches are consistently excellent. They also need to clean the filter in their soda machine.",2
1353,We love it here. We always stay in the Tuscany tower. The furnishings are a little over the top BUT the beds are super comfy and there's tons of room to relax. The bathrooms are the nicest I've ever seen. The pool complex is huge and every pool has a different water temp. Cool!  The restaurants are all good and the cocktails are amazing (and different at every restaurant).  We just returned from our third visit in the last eight months and can't wait to go back!!,4
1354,"Ok, yes, the ribs are good.  My reason for the lousy rating was the mis-information in their advertising announcing something to the effect that the Rib Cook-off features ""the largest arts and crafts show in Nevada.""  Really??  We must have missed that because all we saw were row after row of booths selling tons of cheesy commercial merchandise.  I mean how many toe ring booths do we need?  Hey Nugget, how about next year a little more truth in advertising, or at least have your people attend a REAL craft show so you know what one is supposed to look like.",2
1355,"I'm always getting menus from Chinese restaurants and pizzerias, but when you have your standbys, it's not easy for a new place to catch your eye. The menu for Queen came this week, and I wanted to try a few things from their rather large vegetarian selection. They have the usual veggie and bean curd (a.k.a. tofu) entrees, but they also have mock chicken, beef, and duck. We actually ordered carryout the same day I read the menu - I was excited!

The food was okay, but I have to admit, it was disappointing. Part of me wants to try another few dishes, but that part is being told to quiet down and not be so charitable. 

First up - moo shu vegetables. I usually love the cabbage and sweet sauce, and this had the bonus of including broccoli, baby corn, and mushrooms. But the pancakes were dry, stuck together, and inedible. The corn tasted like a can. Not great.

Next, vegetarian ""beef"" with mixed vegetables. The beef tasted like my homemade attempts at seitan, where the stuff still tastes like flour. The sauce was good, but the dish was unremarkable. 

Finally, we ordered one of the Chef's Specialties - bean curd with general tso's sauce. The silken tofu was deep fried and coated with a sticky, sugary sauce, and there were a few pieces of broccoli alongside. Very disappointing - no spice, no heat, and just sugar and fat for appeal. 

The two star rating means I've had better. My absolute favorite is Wild Ginger in Huntingdon Valley, and I also prefer China Garden Inn in Willow Grove. I was hoping for a good take out place closer to home, but this isn't it.",2
1356,"Great experience here. It looks like a bit of a dive from outside but the coconut rice, pad thai and stir fry were all perfect. 

We will definitely be coming back again. I'm looking forward to trying the curry and stay!

This is a must if you love Thai food.",5
1357,"A very interesting replacement to the late night special LaPeniche. Horn's is a restaurant who's chef is one of my friends but on this occasion he was off and as I viewed the menu there were very few options. Saturday and Sunday are brunch days but I got there too late for that as they stop at 3pm. I did not want to order anything too outstanding since the head chef was not there so I got just a regular roast beef poboy featuring their house made beef daube. The sandwich was served on vietnamese style french bread and was very tasty but at $9 for just the sandwich and no side I thought that was a bit steep as the sandwich was not that big to stand alone. A great side would have been house made chips and then you could charge $10 with no problem. I assume that there are daily chef specials because the menu is a bit short and a tad over priced. Overall it seems that Horn's is one of these tweeners, white collar food in a blue collar style, but so far to be honest I long for the days of LaPaniche. I will be back for breakfast since that seems to be the most popular dishes served here or maybe a chef special or two.",3
1358,"Me and my boyfriend went there for lunch. 

1. Food : yummy and delicious. 
2. Service : our server was attentive and nice, and our main dish came out little bit late, we didn't even complain at all or get frustrated about it. But the manager came over and insisted our bill be put on the house. We couldn't argue that!! :D it was sweet of him. 
3. Atmosphere : I loveeee their atmosphere so much. Big and high ceiling, wide open space. I definitely like this place more than Cheesecake Factory. LOVE IT!

Grandlux cafe will stay as one of our monthly places to eat.",5
1359,"Very friendly staff EVERY time I've been in there. Usually there's one bad apple on the schedule at every place but not here in my experience. Quick, efficient, and healthy. A nice grab and go type of operation, and free parking at the end if the block!",5
1360,"I just called for a quote on a part for my vehicle, and received horrible customer service. They were extremely rude and treated me like I was an idiot. I felt stupid after hanging up the phone and definitely won't be taking my car there. Canadian tire should hire nicer employees in their service department. Not impressed.",1
1361,Flashback!  My old happy hour spot. Great outdoor patio. Glad I got one last visit in. They are closed now and new restaurant is on the way.,2
1362,"This was good. Great salsa and guacamole, meats were fresh and had good flavor. Chicken fajitas were good but not very flavorful, tasted like a healthier version, as if something was missing. Steak fajita taco salad was really good. We were sat quickly and served right away.",4
1363,Fast casual mexican food with a salsa bar. Feels like a Chipotle but much better! Plus it's byob.,4
1364,Great location and nice staff. Housekeeping is ok. They made our beds but didn't pick up the towels on the floor and didn't replace.,3
1365,"My family and I went over a show at the Walnut (5 minute walk which was awesome) and was recommended by two friends to try it out. Honestly thought the price was a little expensive for what you got, especially my meal of a Turkey Pot Pie which was $19 and that's all you got, no soup or salad or side. Don't get me wrong, everything that we had tasted really good, but for comfort food it wasn't comforting when I got the check. Definitely recommend the Chicken Parm, Mac & Cheese and if you don't mind the price the Turkey or Chicken Pot Pie (depending on what they have). Also I highly recommend getting a booth on the mezzanine over looking the whole restaurant, it was nice to be a little secluded from everyone else and had that sense of VIP. Only problem is that sometimes a server won't be right there when you need one and will have to wait for them to come back upstairs.  For an overall experience and the fact that it was a Stephen Starr restaurant it was good, just thought it could have been a little more for the price I paid.",4
1366,I have been getting my eyelash extensions done with Anna for awhile now. Her attention to detail is always amazing. This last time I was too busy and couldn't get in for four weeks and I was still getting compliments until I went in for my appointment!! You need to check her out and her room is too freaking cute!,5
1367,"I wanted to like this place,  I really did.  I understand what previous reviewers said about stake bagels.  My opinion is that they may just be different than most are used to.  Either way I did end up throwing the top half away.

Everything else was fine but there weren't tons of people there either. Just wad quite disappointed with the bagel itself.",2
1368,"I find it difficult to rate a chain, but this location is one of the closest to me, although not much a coffee drinker, I do visit more than the others.  I have never had a poor beverage from this location, and recently they started serving limited gluten free treats.  I spotted a wrapped 2pk of chocolate cookies in the case yesterday. The USA menu is coming up here, just slower than molasses.

They upgraded a while back and added power outlets. Handy in a pinch!

Yes, I definitely come back. And you should get a Starbucks card and the app for the perks. So easy to pay from my phone if I forget my wallet - heck even if I have my card or wallet. Gold stars! Earn beverage upgrades, and freebies. Nothing wrong with that.",4
1369,"We sat outside on the veranda and ate from the happy hour menu the first night.  The drinks were really great, the atmosphere was perfect, and the music was good.  It was really relaxing and calm.  I would stay at Peppermill anytime and would come to this place everytime.  We returned the next evening and it was just as good.",5
1370,"Ordered a meatball parm hero to go, very good! Bread was amazing and toasted to perfection. Sauce was excellent. Could've used some more cheese. 

They were nice over the phone, had my order ready 15 mins after the call. Very nice when picking up as well. I'll be back!",4

1372,"Had a bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.  Bagel was a bit thin (which I like) and very soft. Great breakfast sandwich. Ordered ahead and it was ready when I arrived 10 minutes later. Didn't have a donut but they had loads of flavors and they all looked delicious.",4
1373,"Absolutely love coming to Tires Plus in Lutz . I've been coming back for years because of the wonderful service we always get . John Nietubicz has excellent customer service and he has been the one I've dealt with many times in the past . Today we were helped by a gentleman named Brad ,who I found out recently transferred from the New Port Richey store . He was  on top of every step that was being done to my daughter's car . It's always such a pleasure coming to this location - loyal customer here ! Thanks guys ! Highly recommended. Five stars is not enough to rate this store !",5
1374,"Hotel Monaco is diagonally across the street from Independence Hall which makes it great for tourists but anyone will appreciate the amenities, hospitality, and cleanliness of this fine hotel. The classically elegant yet boutique quirkiness of the decor is Wes Anderson-esque. Some of the thoughtful amenities include an evening wine hour, umbrella and yoga mat in the closet, and C.O. Bigelow soaps. They offer valet parking and there is a garage around the block. It met and exceeded my expectations for a four or five star hotel. I can't think of anything bad to say about it.",5
1375,"Delicious organic burger, but a bit overpriced for the size. Sweet potato fries excellent, but also overpriced.  Service is good.",3
1376,"Evething about This Resturant is great!
1- brew there own soy sauce

1378,"The Posada Lodge is an old property. Probably built around 1980. Each unit is small. Attached to the lodge is a restaurant (cantina) featuring finger food and a large variety of tequila mixed drinks. The property has potential. Unfortunately the property has been neglected. It is rundown. Furniture, fixtures, walls the bathroom all need to be updated and revitalized. That said would I stay again on this property?  Yes if for a night. No if I was looking for a holiday destination.",2
1379,"really disappointed on a visit there this week.  the therapist was nice enough but wasn't very good giving massages.  Touch was too light.  I like deep tissue massages and while I pointed out exactly where a knot needed to be worked on, the massage was ineffectual and weak.  Even though the therapist kept saying she could feel the knot being reduced in size, i didn't feel any change at all and left after a 30 minute massage with the knot, same size and same pain.",2
1380,"Rude customer service, unprofessional service, not worthy to waste your time to come here.",1
1381,"Perfect place to go  if you like waiting 20 minutes at the counter and getting dirty looks from the waiters while you're waiting for service. My friend and I made the mistake of coming here after being famished after a long day. Hey Johnny Rockets, I understand that you guys can get busy, but a quick acknowledgment that we existed would have sufficed. After finally waving down a waitress, we finally got a menu with a heavy sigh on the side as if we were troubling the staff. I urged my friend that we should probably leave, but we had already waited long enough, so I reluctantly ordered.
I got the original burger and fries as did my friend as per usual. Don't get me wrong, the burgers and fries are decent but definitely not worth the wait or hassle. Even the chocolate shake that I ordered was pretty good with a good consistency, but the taste of bad service still lingered and eventually overpowered the chocolate flavored concoction. Needless to say, I will definitely not be coming back to this location if it continues to be managed so rudely.",2
1382,"The food was amazing and the service was great.  We went early on a Saturday night and it was already busy.  We had the guacamole and the spicy beets as appetizers.  The guacamole was pleasantly spicy.  I personally had the salmon and while it was good, the vegetable flan side was the best part of the dish.  My husband had a seafood dish that was great, and one of my sons had the empanadas which were very flavorful and the pastry was light and flaky.  It started to get a bit noisy, so it's not the best place to hold a conversation, but the decor is very trendy and does not match the outside at all.  We all agreed we would be coming back again!",5
1383,Service was decent. Food was over priced and mediocre. Crab stuffed shrimp was greasy and soggy and the steak was over cooked(ordered medium rare) came out Barely pink and flavorless. Calamari was decent. Not just the rings. Ordered off the kids menu for my two year old and the plate came out too hot to touch. The only reason for the two starts is that servers get the benefit of the doubt from me.,2
1384,"Inconsistent quality - pizza review only

Ordering a pizza from these guys is a roll of the dice.  Sometimes it is fresh and delicious, other times it is not so fresh with regards to the dough.  Tonight we had the latter with our plain cheese pizza.  When they are using fresh dough we think the pizza tastes delicious.  For this reason they are our go-to place for pizza in the area.  On more than one occasion, though, our pizza seemed to have been made from a dough ball that had either been improperly stored resulting in the outer surface becoming hardened before it was modeled into a pie crust;  or it was just plain old and stale.  Hence the reason for this review and the two-stars.  My hope is Franco's will see this and adjust their practices to provide the freshest quality always.",2
1385,"My friend from out of town is a burger connoisseur so I thought this place would be the perfect place to take him for a casual lunch. The burger of the month at the time included pork belly, an edamame spread, and some sweet and tangy asian sauce that was amazing! I'd heard a lot about the duck fat fries so we ordered them, but to be honest I was a little disappointed at how bland they were. It was a bit emptier at that time of day so the service was fine, but I wouldn't necessarily come back.

I've also been here for the bar at night, which I prefer. Limited seating but really delicious drinks!",3
1386,"first off the service is absolutely terrible. the waiter only came over to take our order and bring us our drinks and food. after that when we needed something we practically had to look around to hunt him down during our entire meal. he never bothered to come over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills or how our food was. even when we wanted our check he was no where to be found. 
as for the food; my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn't even warm, it was room tempature. than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings (4/person) well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate; if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out. 
when we brought it up to the waiters attention; after having to look for him for 15 mins, his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he'll bring us another wing. we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes. so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take. i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so I asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn't around. now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out; that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager. because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil. 
when we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said ""I guarantee the chefs didn't count this as a wing"" and that ""they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing"". it was 20 wings for $20 so his solution was telling us he'll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted. 
i felt like that was a slap to my face and I felt a little discriminated, like if I wasn't asian things would've been different. I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie, all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they ""miscounted"" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps)
tonight is the last time I'm ever eating/drinking here and i will no longer be recommending people to come here.",1
1387,"I really want to give Taj India a break because I really appreciate them for being there. Northeast Philly is desperate for decent Indian food, and Taj is definitely decent Indian food. Decent. Sometimes great, sometimes kind of lacking, but almost always decent. However as far as Indian food goes I've had much better for the same or similar price within 20-30 minute driving distance. 

I never eat in the place, it's a little depressing looking and often with weird music playing...but it's clean...I just prefer home in this case.

Oh, they also have a wide array of Indian desserts but I think they  might be too authentic for most Americans' taste...not sure...I'm not into trying random sweets but that's what I've heard.

Stuff I love about Taj: they make dosas! but also do a good job at north Indian dishes like Channa Masala, fairly cheap, call in your order and pick it up! The food reheats fairly well in a warm oven or a quick dump into a pot on the stove. Viola! Like new! Oh and its all vegetarian! 

Stuff I don't love: I have to ask 5 times to get enough mint chutney, the sambhar is a little salty at times, some of the curries aren't that good (don't do the black dahl! go for channa masala. Also the naans are really good as are a lot of the appetizers, including the samosas. 

All in all, it's a great find for the area, but it's sometimes hit or miss on some of the dishes. However the naan, samosas, and channa masala have been consistantly good.",3
1388,"Hubby and I were looking for a fresh seafood restaurant and stopped here late on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the tenderloin because I miss the good midwestern tenderloin sandwiches. For those. not from the midwest where breaded tenderloin was originated I'm sure they considered it great. BUT it was breaded with a much-too-garlicky seafood breading, NOT cracker crumbs as that are meant to be. I tasted that breading for hours afterward.  The fries were pretty good, however. The biggest problem is the restaurant was nearly empty and yet it took nearly 30 minutes to get our food.  Our waitress was very friendly but didn't apologize for the delay.",2
1389,"Never been in the area before this time.  I liked the falafel and baklava from Bitar's.  Overall the food was reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is not conducive for a sit down restaurant, but definitely great for take out.  I would go there if again if in the area.",3
1390,"I bought a groupon for a 4 person buffet and a $25 game card. The games are incredibly expensive. I've been there 2 times before. Everything has gone up. The 'token' games that are there.... $1.25 gets you 4 tokens. Stick with chuck e cheese, food is just as bad, games are half the price.",2
1391,"I used to love Randall's.  I will never go back.  They are now charging $100 for Weller antique.  You can buy this on wine searcher for $40.  It retails for around $20.  They're also charging $47 for eagle rare which isn't very rare and $50 for a $20 bottle of sazerac.  $999 for a bottle of old rip van winkle 10 year.  Have you lost your minds?   I like patronizing local stores and supporting small businesses but they're rude and they're ripping people off.  Enjoy you 400% markups and warm beer.  I'll be shopping at total wine and wine and cheese where they treat people with respect and charge $20 for Weller 12 and $30 for eagle rare.

Amend: A pleasant surprise - they are raffling 4 bottles van winkle 12 for $59.99.  Kudos for listening to your customers.",3
1392,"In town for only a day we tried to find a good breakfast.  This place was not crowded, and I needed my coffee fix. So, we decided to try it. Service is super slow. My coffee tasted like sewer water. The  asparagus mushroom omelet was ok, but not worth the wait. The potatoes were soggy, a definite no-no for the roasted kind. The bagel with Lox was just average. But I can't get that sewer water memory out of my head!!!",1
1393,Decided to try a salon outside of the crazy mall scene. Gave this place a shot. Walk-ins welcome- which is a bonus because you never know when the itch for a haircut will strike. Opens at 9 am on Saturday too! Went in as a walk-in on Saturday at 9 am and Terri was welcoming and took my right away. She was very thorough and detail oriented with my cut. She kept going until I was completely happy with the result. Also the price was very reasonable as well. Definitely recommend and will go back!!,5
1394,"Freddy's has the best fast-food style burgers I've ever had. Great toppings choices and fresh meat. Their fries are delicious with their ""fry"" sauce. Their custard is just as good as their food. It's rich and creamy, and did I mention how delicious it is.",5

1397,"Good burgers, good beer on tap. Last two times have had same server, and she's SOOO SLOW! She insists on waiting multiple tables before putting orders in, and waiting on multiple orders before serving drinks to tables. Yes, this method limits her trips to/from bar, but sometimes people need a water! Would be a 4 or even 5 star if got different service. Had better service on 1st of the 3 visits.",3
1398,A friend suggested this cafe for a lunch date a while back and I cannot stay away. My husband is obsessed with their Peanut Butter Deluxe smoothie. And while Its an obsession I cannot afford to indulge - their bread is what dreams are made of. I love to get their soup due jour over brown rice. Yum! Whether its Breakfast or Lunch - you can't go wrong at Cafe Deluxe.,4
1399,I've been a customer at Ted Peters since 1977 while attending college in St Petersburg and in Tampa. What can I say? ; they have the best smoked fish in the southeast. A laid-back atmosphere and super friendly service. An iced mug cold beer and a smoked mullet fish spread sandwich; it gets you a little bit closer to heaven on a hot Florida day.,5
1400,I had THE best sushi and filet with scallops here! This is a true neighborhood gem. This is our new go-to place for Japanese.,5
1401,"Skipper's used to be a Northwest institution. Founded in Bellevue, Wash., with locations throughout Washington, Oregon and Idaho.

Fast forward 40 years and they're hardly the same. The Fairview location hasn't had a makeover since the mid-1970s when I started going there as a teenager.

The fish used to be hand-breaded and had a fish and chips texture. Today, the fish is limp and appears frozen with the breading taking place as a factory and not at the store.

The fries used to be special but now they're no different than any brand found in the frozen case at a grocery store.

The clam chowder, on the other hand, is still pretty good. It doesn't seem any different from what was offered years ago.",3
1402,"This is the most unprofessional business I have ever been to. I went here because my former optometrist shut down and transferred the charts here. The employees make you feel like you are bothering them from the minute you walk in or call. Multiple times they couldn't find my chart, couldn't find record of the contacts they ordered, never called me back when they said they would, and acted annoyed every time I asked a question. Don't waste your time by going here.",1
1403,"I came here for lunch with a few friends. The place was packed, but we were able to push together a few tables. The staff was quick and friendly. Did not have any trouble.

Everything I had was good, but nothing special. I ordered the Frenchie sandwich. It was good, but not enough sprouts on the sandwich. The bread was good, but I should have gotten it toasted. There was a total of 10 in my group and we all received our food quickly. If I went back, I would probably do the soup & sandwich combo. 

For dessert, I got the gooey butter cake. It was really good and a good sized portion. It was so large that I ended up sharing it with everyone in my group.

Overall, I would recommend this to others and go back there myself.",4
1404,"I was technically a member at this gym from February of 2012 until this past February, though I stopped going months before that point.

When I signed up, I had great intentions of working out all of the time, but then my workload increased (okay, I AM listing off excuses, but whatever) and my back started hurting horribly to the point that I was having trouble walking (turns out I do have diagnosed back issues now.) I went in looking to cancel my contract -- thinking I just had to give two months notice. I had no idea upon signing the contract in February that it was a year-long commitment. It just wasn't made clear.

I ended up paying a bulk price at once to cover my membership without debits each month on my bank account, but that honestly still peeves me a little when I think of Retro. I just think contracts should be made more clear up front.

Otherwise, it's a pretty decent gym. $19.99/month, but they have some random bi-yearly charges, too, which would spike up the per month price if you really think about it. The bathrooms were clean and the machines were nice. I was always one of those girls who would go in the movie theater area - a nice perk.

Now if my boyfriend was the one writing this review, it would have 10 stars up top. He is there whenever he has a free second!",3
1405,"This review is for take out only. I ordered the Hot Honey Chicken, it was cold and just okay. They didn't trim the fat off the chicken. I requested extra crispy french fries they came cold wet and soggy. They quoted 45 minutes and the order arrived in 1 hour and 15 minutes. Don't get take out from here, they don't have their ducks in a row yet. I'll will give them another try but in dining only.",1

The Place is pretty clean. Being that I had stayed here before about 5yrs ago.
So I called to see if there were any rooms available, which there was, they quoted me a price but when I go there it was $30 above what they had quoted me. I needed to rest so I ended up paying the $160
I gave them 3 stars because the bed was hard and Walls are thin, can hear ppl next door talking and ppl upstairs walking. I was tired and wanted to rest after a long drive but it made it a bit difficult withe the noise.",3
1407,honestly this place is hit or miss. I ALWAYS get the same thing. Jr bacon cheeseburgers and fries. sometimes the fries are hot but alot of the times they arnt. I'll either get a good burger or like the other night a burger w green tomatos. But then again you get what you pay for at a fast food restaurant.,2
1408,"The Pho was very good. The broth itself was fantastic- the chicken appeared to be lunchmeat. Maybe that's how all Pho is, I don't know, but I was expecting something better. But the soup itself made it alright. I'd absolutely go back.",4
1409,"I decided to give this place a try though my go to
pizza place is Angelos on Larchmont. Well, the delivery was prompt and everything was hot thus the two stars. I ordered the chicken cutlet sandwich on a seeded roll but asked for sautéed spinach instead of broccoli rabe, which they gave me. Unfortunately, the sautéed spinach had no taste and I didn't taste any sharp provolone cheese either (you would have surely tasted it). I had to add garlic powder, red pepper flakes and grated parm cheese so it had some taste. The seeded roll was the winner. As a result of the good reviews of the rice balls I decided to order them. Gross - right in the trash. To all of the New Yorkers who ate here and said it was as good as New York Italian food doesn't know good food from mediocre food. Back to Angelos. Best food around!",2
1410,"The rating is, ""As good as it get,"" but honestly I'm not sure because this was my first time eating Moroccan food.

I ordered the Shawarma cus I like the way it sounds.  With every bite the sandwich got better and better.  I didn't want it to end.  

Mmmmm...kiss the cook

Staff is friendly and answered questions...so plus 1 for that",5
1411,"We ordered take out from here the other night.  We were pretty excited about take out sushi in the area so we gave it a shot.  The menu wasn't that impressive, kind of a boring selection, but we ordered a few rolls and the staff was friendly and the delivery prompt.  The rolls themselves weren't anything exciting, but were tasty enough.  We'll probably order from here again when we're too lazy to go out and get sushi.",3
1412,"Although the cantina at La Cocina is my fav spot, I do enjoy popping in here for a whiskey or European beer education from time to time. They've also got a rotating lineup of local beers. The inside and little outside patio are dog friendly as long as your pups are well behaved. It's a super charming little place with bumper tables and actual tables to sit at.",4
1413,"This is an experience, not just a meal.

Found in an alley-ish way of south street, Philadelphia, when you walk in, you are immediately transported to Morocco with the endless of carpets and tapestries hung on the walls, the music, and very dim lighting. 

About three floors, there are some private rooms if you have large parties - which they are very accommodating. Also have I mentioned it's BYOB (this is why Philadelphia is the best) - so feel free to bring whatever. They will provide the wine glasses and ice.

Now to the food. It is like an 8 course meal and I believe standardized - so being there  my second time, I knew what to expect. Served family style and without utensils so be prepared to just dig in with your hands - be careful the dishes come out very hot.

All the courses are great, some better than others. The lamb on the bone (forget what course number that was) is insanely good. No worries if you're a vegetarian, they are super accommodating and will bring out a separate plate for you. Some people love the 2nd course but I'm not the biggest fan - some type of powdered sugar pastry with eggs/chicken mix in it. Definitely keep an open mind here and just take in the experience.

There are also belly dancers that will come around and dance for your party. 

The atmosphere is conducive for large parties! 

Definitely on the pricier side - ends up being about 30 bucks per person, so do know you are paying for the entire experience, not just the food. Also, FYI, it is cash only... which kinda sucks

I would suggest everyone come here at least once!",4
1414,"If i could leave zero stars, I would. This company was hired to do Rosemont College's commencement photo's for every student. I received mine today, and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. The person taking the shot took zero time to say, ""Hey, your sash is hanging down, let's fix that before we take this."" Instead, they were too busy rushing people through (even though there was more than enough time between each student). I ended up with a horrible unprofessional looking photo.

The worst part about this, is that after the person took the photo, they looked at it on their camera and said ""looks good"". Seriously? Thankfully I got pictures of my own and don't have to rely on these supposed professionals to have capture this even for me.",1
1415,"The food is great, simple as that. The only reason it's not a five star place is because the nachos were a bit burned and it's kinda pricey for a casual place. But loved it either way. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good taco and yummy margarita.",4
1416,"The food here is really solid and the staff is fantastically friendly. I get the brisket and sausage combo with two small sides. Plus... free soft served ice cream for the taking!

The downside? The east parking lot is a disaster is trap with low hanging  tree branches that scraped my paint.

Also at busy times the design to get condiments and drinks is bad. It creates traffic congestion as you have to fight across an aisle to get drinks, pickles etc.",4

1418,"Was downtown indy today, 12/5/15, for the Indy Children's Choir. After the performance we decided to eat at Granite City in the mall. The mall  and the restaurant were busy because of the Iowa and Michigan game. 
 There was a wait of about 40 min,  which was ok. 
My complaint is that once we got seated,  there was a wait until our server came over,  he took drink order and drinks came in a reasonable time. We then had to wait about 20 min for server to take our food order. There were only two of us. I ordered the half chicken salad sandwich and side salad. My daughter ordered a burger. My salad came pretty quickly but it felt like forever before our food came.
Ok the place was busy. I get that. But you would have anticipated that you would be busy because of the game,  why didn't you have adequate wait staff to handle the extra business? 
Also,  my half chicken salad sandwich  had about 4 pieces of diced chicken and one grape. It was topped with a big bunch of lettuce. It was a sad looking half sandwich for $9.",2

Lots of tasty sounding choices, but I chose the Loaded Butterscotch and the Nutter Butter on a chocolate waffle cone. No complaints! Both were outstanding, and the butterscotch was definitely the sweeter of the two but I'm a huge PB fan so I liked them both equally. The only negative would be that the scoops were on the small side...",4
1421,"The donuts are amazing but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't order something with the praline bacon. The egg, bacon biscuit is as delicious as it is instagram worthy. The coffee holds its own too. District Donuts was the highlight of our visit so far.",5

They'd added new items to the food menu, and there's now a full list of classic & more exotic tiki drinks in the tiki bar out back. I've been to quite a few tiki bars across the country (it's a hobby), and I can honestly say Rev is still one of my favorites. Classic, kitchy decor, great music, super chill, and the drinks are on point. They have hundreds of tequilas if you're not into mixed drinks and the food is reliably delicious. I usually go for the potato or pork tacos. Try the dirty deeds hot sauce.",5
1426,"Stopped at this diner because of all the great reviews, however, it didn't live up to the reviews I read, at least not for us. 

One, as soon as you walk in there was a bucket & newspapers because the roof was leaking. Now, this is not uncommon weather for it to constantly rain. If you looked up at the ceiling you could see how the tiles were holding on to water as if could fall at any second. 

Second, food was flavorless. However, food arrived promptly and the service was okay.",2

If this was the first time I had étouffée, I would have never ordered it again. The crawfish didn't look or taste fresh. The dish itself tasted more like a watery gumbo. We also ordered a side of fried green tomatoes, which were pretty good. Along with that, we ordered the healthy breakfast, which was a good dish. There are way better food places than this one. Save your time and money and go somewhere else.",3
1431,"This has been our 'go to' restaurant for any night out for the last year.  Everything is delicious, but you can't go wrong with the cauliflower, sweet plantains, red drum, and paella to name a few.  Their drinks from the bar are exquisite, but I always order a livery margarita with salt...well two or three over the course of dinner if I'm being honest.  The atmosphere is fun and exciting, the staff are friendly and accommodating, and if you can get a seat on the roof, then it doesn't get much better than that. We love everything about this place! If anyone from out of town visits, we take them here for the unique experience and tasty dishes.",5
1432,"The service was solid and friendly. The food was good, but it was a little over-priced. I got the Longhorn burger and ordered it medium rare. It was very yummy. Also, their large fries is enough to feed two people. 

Their milkshake game is a little weak. Oh, and if you want to have a conversation with someone, they play their music a little too loud. Other than those things, it's a solid place for groups, and it has a quirky atmosphere.",3
1433,"I went to Levante for the first time yesterday and I'm not sure why it took me so long to get there. It has a different, but very refreshing feel to it. The business model revolves around having relationships with patrons and conversation instead of mindless TV and phones in our faces. 
It works! It was such a pleasant atmosphere. The bartenders are very nice, the other patrons at the bar were nice, and the beer was exceptional! The room is pleasant and clean, as were the bathrooms. 
I couldn't decide on what to have to drink. The list of beer offerings is extensive and I ended up having 2 flights which was 8 different types of beer. 
I absolutely enjoyed every single one. I had IPAs, pumpkin ale, a gose, a beer infused with Earl Grey tea! (which was amazing), and a delicious wheat wine. You really can find something for every taste there. 
If you haven't stopped in, you should! It was a delightful experience and I can't wait to go back.",5
1434,"Made to order by friendly folks, their falafel is perhaps the best in the region. The hummus and home made potato chips are a great start. Would love to see green lettuce on the falafel (iceberg is an insult to their great yogurt sauce) and a non sweet tea option. Otherwise, food great, prices ok, and can't wait to get back.",4
1435,"I love coming to this show! The first time I went to it when it was much smaller at the Enjoy centre. But sometimes less is more  There are so many awesome vendors here, but being a self professed foodie, my favourites were the food vendors!! Oh and Soo many samples!!! I ended up with a bag of dumplings, bottle of infused vodka, 6 bottles of wine, 2 meat pies (we had these for dinner, so yummy!) A bag of dehydrated mushrooms, a bag of cookies...and I almost came home with a bag of kick ass caramels. But as you can see I was over my budget limit  I have to give some shout outs to the awesome Alberta vendors I bought from... Spirit Hills Winery, Black Diamond Distillery, Untamed Feast, South Island Pie Company. You guys rock!!",5
1436,"Best pizza in my neighborhood. Better than NYPD, Zios, Pandora's, etc. I highly recommend the personal size for one person. Their eggplant pizza is outstanding. I'm also a big fan of sausage and mushroom. The sausage is actual slices of Italian sausage, not those nasty crumbly bits you get at a lot of places. Prices are reasonable.

Haven't been too impressed with the rest of the menu, but for pizza near Jefferson, I don't think you can do any better. Burgers aren't bad too.",4
1437,this place reminds of camping. it is not a resort. we had a block of rooms reserved for 6 months and when we checked in two people were given rooms with no beds ! how could a marriot resort even think that is acceptable. management did not correct the issue after several requests. i checked out. there are several nice hotels near resort with shuttle service. a confirmed reservation means nothing - even if a marriot elite membet. i would have rated zero if possible.,1
1438,"Mary is an amazing Acupuncturist.  I had a severely injured ankle from a car accident that was very painful and swollen.  After a treatment from Mary, the swelling and pain were gone!
I truly believe in the healing abilities of Acupuncture and Mary is the best the most intuitive and knowledgeable healer.  I highly recommend her for even the simplest energy tune-up to the most difficult health issue you may have!",5
1439,It was amazing!! It was so hot but once the music started I didn't care how hot it was anymore. You can tell that the members of the band loved what they do. It was so much fun and an amazing experience. I would go all of the time if I lived closer.,5
1440,"Very cool spot with nice people, good drinks, great music. 4 stars instead of 5 because a VERY popular restaurant that is located in a place that has rain almost daily and has mostly outdoor seating has failed to realize umbrellas at tables are a thing.",4
1441,"Maybe i didn't order the right thing? I had a latte and it was decent but i couldn't taste as much of the espresso and tasted much of the cream from the latte art. My friends got the drafts and it was also just ok in my book. Perhaps i would appreciate the pour overs more but one would expect all the coffee drinks to be solid in a coffee house. It looked like their drink menu was limited to pour overs, espresso latte, and drafts so none of the pizzaz of Sbux. Drinks were kinda pricey for the size and quality imho.

The space was free and inviting. In fact most of the tables were filled. The large windows allowed for lots of light which was great on a sunny day like that day.",3
1442,"The service at this location is TERRIBLE. Twice in the last month, I have gone there for lunch and it took 25 minutes from the time I paid for my bowl until the time they called my name. Absolutely ridiculous. The other locations aren't like this. I really don't understand. They have such a good product but this location needs some serious help with their service.",2
1443,"Meet by a great hostess at the door, Jenna. Her smile was amazing! Drinks at the bar were rather good.  They actually have a loco moco! BOOM!",5
1444,"My sandwich was average. The meat had ok flavor, it needed more cheese, but the whole wheat bread was delicious! It's in a great location to for grabbing a sandwich before or after you board.",3
1445,"The staff is friendly, the bank is clean, and they always have suckers (win!) but I do have a few problems with this location...first, they never seem to have enough people working (always a long wait), second, they cannot notarize wills (weird!), and third, they cannot let another staff member serve as a witness for a notary (Wells Fargo does!). So, yeah. Friendly and abundant suckers as pluses; limited staff and limited options as negatives.",3
1446,This is my favorite pizza place in Tucson! Great food! Great service! Relaxing atmosphere! And did I mention the super stix! You haven't lived until you've tried the super stix!,5
1447,"The food and service were really good!  My only complaint is the seating is so awkward, we were seated inches from the hostess stand and the entrance. Try the seafood gumbo, it was excellent!",4
1448,"Food was great. Line took FOREVER!! Not exactly sure why. There were only about three families in line in front of me, but I waited in the line for 20 full minutes!??",3
1449,"No complaints with our stay here! The property and very lush and well taken care of! The rooms all face into the center with a nice garden view...some rooms even have an ocean view. The hotel has a PRIME location being directly across from the harbor and also the beach. From check-in to checkout the staff was wonderful. Wine and cheese are available every day from 5-7 and the continental breakfast from 6-10. Our room was very spacious and no question, very clean! The pool area is beautiful and also well taken care of. The canopy over the hot tub gives a very luxurious feel. The pool and hot tub both light up a beautiful purple shade at night and there were even people swimming in the heated pool after dark in March! The hotel was pretty quick during our stay, although the sign out front showed ""no vacancy"". Great place to stay and I would definitely consider that place on a future trip to SB!",5
1450,"food was ok but it took them 30 mins to plate our food. then they gave us a lame excuse of needing to redo one plate. mean while 3 tables after us where served the same dish. where i come from that ain't right. The only reason they received 2 stars is after mentioning the time it took, they gave us a discount, the reality is the food is just so so. plenty of other places around with better food.",2
1451,Cute place to eat at. Ate breakfast here and was dissappointed after seeing such good reviews. Breakfast menu is very limited. The omlet was just OK.  Biscuit didnt have much flavor to it. We were able to be seated really quick (during the week) but i imagine it getting really crowded during the weekends.,3
1452,"I have eaten in the restaurant twice and thought the food was good but fair service. I recently placed an order for an event and was notified by email less than 24 hours before that this could not take place with no apology or offer to make up for this inconvenience. As a full time working mom this totally screwed me for a work event I had planned for and ended up using Whole Foods who came to the rescue. I also contacted crumb de la crumb about a Birthday cake with no return response. So, in a nutshell, I would recommend trying the food by dining in, but do not hold your breath on catering or friendliness of staff.",2
1453,"I used Signature Parking for a party at a friend's house in Montecito in May. They came through on short notice and were very reasonable in pricing (though they could have easily gouged a desperate, last-minute customer). From Justin, who arranged everything, to the bookeeper who settled our account, the customer service was friendly and professional in every way. The valets were great to work with and handled all parking tasks and special requests seamlessly. They were always available at a moment's notice and stayed on the job. 

I wish every service business operated as well as Signature Parking. I would use them again, and recommend them without reservation.",5
1454,"I am an exec level who pretty much uses national every week for business travel.   Last week I returned the car on Wednesday.   They forgot to check it in or something so they kept calling me every day asking when I was going to return the car.     They gave a phone number that didn't connect to the right people so I had to go through the telephone tag game.   Every day they called with a robo call despite me already working with their staff on the issue.   Finally on Monday they send an email saying they found the car but now want to charge me through Sunday, which is apparently when they found it.

I get mistakes happen.   But why keep calling me and why send me a bill thru Sunday when I was working with customer service?    

Normally I don't have issues, but customer care fell down on this one.",1
1455,"The day before I leave for Las Vegas for my bachelor party boo suggests we spend a healthy and romantic evening together by eating at Agno for dinner then walking down to Lite Choice. Considering the next meal I would have would be a Heineken courtesy of Southwest Airlines at 7:30 in the morning I figured maybe it would be a good idea to keep in healthy. 

Walking in I almost felt like ET when the government comes in and throws him on a table in the blue tent. It was so bright in there I felt like all my blemishes and insecurities would be exposed. It's a very big store, much larger than other froyo places in the city and is well equipped to feed the masses in the dead of summer. 

When I walked to the counter the girl working there was very friendly and gave me a few suggestions which I didn't take and I actually went for the Tres Leche which is coconut and dulce de leche mixed. I got a medium with carob chips on top and it came out over $6. I expected to pay a lot  just because that seems to be the theme of Phila yogurt shops. What was interesting is that they whipped the yogurt once it was in the cup to make it seem bigger. I thought this was kinda weird, I'd rather have some dense yogurt than something light and airy but whatev.

The flavor was really good. Not mind blowing but really good. What I really liked most about is that it's all organic and they don't use high fructose corn syrup. That is extremely important to me. Most places don't use hormone treated diary so that was almost expected but the corn syrup was a nice touch.

I can't say this would be my first choice but I can definitely see myself going back here.",3
1456,"We sat at a pretty hectic lunch at Johnny rockets in the casino. Our server was Lyndel! She was awesome! Helped us at every needy request lol... Good was good, too! I'm too full",5
1457,"Loved this place, the margaritas were phenomenal and the salmon dish was an incredibly interesting twist. Our party of three really enjoyed all the food, had a few different tacos and a couple other items on the menu. Overall, very creative twist on Mexican cuisine. 

Was skeptical after seeing the reviews, but half of them were for the service not being up to par or because some people wanted more food for the price. 

My opinion is that if people want a huge plate of beans, rice, and whatever other crap traditional Mexican includes - go to your cookie cutter chevys or on the border to pay $15 for a plate to feed an entire Nicaraguan family with tasteless food - this is more expensive and lighter portions because the dishes are very well thought out, with plenty of ""out of the norm"" ingredients, which seemed to our party to be extremely fresh (including the margaritas). Also, did not find the portions to be small as I was stuffed when I left, those complaining might want to go on a diet as well.

Service seemed fine, I think all those negative reviews were from when the place first opened. Suckers come on here to trash this place and then rave about applebees. Those morons should have gone to Golden Corral instead and given them a 5 star review for eating the ""fresh"" wet dog food they are served at the joint.",5
1458,New Thai spot in the Palm Pointe plaza. I ordered Chicken Pad Thai - rice noodles in a peanut sauce. This $7.50 lunch special comes with an appetizer; I chose a spring roll. Also got a Thai tea. Didn't take long for my food either! Yum!!,5
1459,We were big fans when they first opened however our last visit was less than impressive.  The server seemed disconnected and bored.  The fish is still good but the paper napkins are a red flag that perhaps even management has lost its way.,4
1460,"Almost went to this location, but did a pivot turn when we had to step over three different types of trash just to get to the front door. Also trash scattered around the parking lot. Can't imagine how clean the kitchen is?",1
1461,"This will be all over the place because it's not simply a straight up review of an eatery. 

Let's start on positive side...
-the food. It's good. Maybe even really good (depending on the time/day). Almost great (at times).  I've had several of the burgers and they are usually good. I've had with bun, and as a wrap. Both good. BUT, if you get as a wrap, tell them to serve on a plate instead of the tray with paper. You start cutting into a juicy burger on paper and you end up eating a lot of paper. The fries are good, but they are hit or miss. 
-hard to find a hotel eatery that is this good. Normally they are substandard even for fast food standards. With that said, the fact that it's part of a hotel is one reason for the inconsistency in quality and the consistent issue with service. 

The not so good...
-service. It just isn't good. From bartenders who are more fixated on their fiends who are visiting to wait staff that are inattentive, absent minded, or untrained/unaware. If I could pick something they are consistent with, it's service issues. 
-the price. This place preys on being convenient for guests of the hotel. It's an expensive burger. The apps and sides are expensive. The beer is expensive. You get the drift. It's expensive. This makes the above item even more amplified. 

There are better alternatives to this place in the area. Unless you are at the hotel and just don't want to go anywhere, I'd try something else. If your stuck, patience and prepare to pay. It will be a good burger, but ultimately, you'll walk away unsatisfied.",3
1462,Wow! The bread was awesome but the service and food was less desirable. The bartenders were a bit more concerned about doing shots with each other than taking care of the paying. The salad I ordered was full of store bought croutons & actually contained the root of the romaine. Interesting.,2
1463,"Their truffle fries is amazing!! And if you like meat and cheese, definitely get the charcuterie platter",5
1464,Horrible service everytime. I have to teach the employees how to make a proper acai bowl. They obviously can't keep or train employees.,1
1465,"I'm bummed I didn't review about this bakery right away. I can't remember the exact cake I got but it was AMAZING. It was some chocolate strawberry concoction with cheesecake in the middle. We left it out on the table for about an hour and yet, when we finally got to the cake, the cheesecake part was still chilled enough to not be mushy. It was absolutely scrumptious. I'll definitely be back to get more in the future!",5
1466,This must be one of the best Thai restaurants in the city! The value is unsurpassed. The curries are to 'write home about',5
1467,"Second time visiting Ooka. Food was great but will not return. My party arrived around 5:30pm on a Friday. We spent $200 dollars on food.  Waitress and managers hovered over our table after we finished dessert. Rushed us to pay our bill and pretty much ran us out of our seats by hovering over us, watching and intensely walking by and throwing doggy bags on our table. We left a 20% tip also. When we finally decided to leave, the hostess basically knocked us over to get to a table. This was between 8 and 8:30pm. I understand that it is a busy Friday night however the rudeness to turn over a table was horrible. One individual in our party came a little late and was still eating. Never again...",1
1468,"Hopefully a bad night but I doubt it based on  the lack of customers. No ribs or pulled pork on a Saturday night, food was sad, dry chicken, tough and cold sliced pork, warm fries, only the waitress was good, but I think she was embarrassed to serve the goods. She deserves better. Where is management?",1
1469,"It's Easter Sunday. The Pancake Pantry had a long, wrap around line so we decided to give this place a try. We were seated right away. There seemed to be a steady flow of food coming out. However, we didn't get our food until 40 minutes later. The waitress apologized for the delay. One of our plates was not hot. We ordered the Grand omelette and biscuits and gravy with side of eggs. The grand was not so grand in flavor.  I was disappointed. The side of eggs was burnt and the biscuits and gravy was cool (not hot) with good flavor but spicy (either not indicated on menu or we missed it). 

Going to the bathroom was a challenge.  The walkway between the front door and bar area was a high traffic area as it was the only way to go from kitchen to the seating area by the open windows and outdoor seating. 

Maybe on any other day, with a different menu item would result in a 3 star rating but not today. The customer service was decent but nothing remarkable to mention.",2
1470,This place has gone downhill over the years. The food quality is bad and the prices are higher. Service can be good or bad depending on day of the week. I never had won-ton soup with little or no pork in the dumpling?  There are too many other Chinese places nearby that offer better tasting Chinese food.,1
1471,"Summary: Their special for the night was the best part. Not a great location or space to have a fancy dinner or throw a big party. I would probably go with family or friends again just because it was the first family owned Italian restaurant of the united states, but besides that I do not really find it overall that special. Too pricey. 

Food: 
Appetizers: Escargots Au gratin ($8.50) The escargots were really large for its size, it was tasty but could be because it was literally all butter. I still enjoyed it, but it could be better if it was less buttery.

Entree: Chicken Parmigiana ($17.00) My opinion is it is a bit too pricey for such a common dish. However, it was a bit crunchier than other chicken parm that I have had.  Besides that I did not find it any special and definitely not worth its price. 

Black Lobsters Raviolis ($20.00) This dish was one of their specials for the night, not on their menus.  It was tasty, but a little too salty and buttery.  It comes with jumbo shrimps and capers.  The dish looks small, but very filling.

Place: 
Location: It is within a residential area, about two (or more) blocks away from South St (Main commercial area). I took a cab there and back (cost about $20). Not easy access. Residential area also means hard to find parking.

Environment: The place has tinted windows, so we cannot see from outside.  The moment you walk in you basically see the whole place, very small.  The tables are cramped on top of each other. I went there on a Tues night, and there was a lot of elders, probably not a young hip place. 

Price: I think the overall pricing is too high.  Two people: 1 appetizer, 2 entree and some fountain drinks came out to be around $60 (with tip).",2
1472,"Thanks, I wanted to order but they won't deliver 4 Miles from their store. I don't understand that one,  but perhaps they don't need the business. Looked great too! Very disappointed for sure.",2
1473,"Bad, bad service, and if you expect the shrimp and crab dip to taste like shrimp and crab, forget about it.",1
1474,"Weekend brunch! Who doesn't like unlimited mimosas for 2 hours to kick off their day? Server was very attentive too, and we never had an empty glass. Good variety to choose meals too, from omelettes to pizzas",5
1475,"Food is expensive and not worth it. My hubby had carnitas - very dry. I had the scallops- expensive and undercooked. Not even a browned crust. Rice was served ""family style "" but do mushy and overlooked. I had a mango margarita that was completely bland and flavorless. We will not be going back. City fish was not good, but this is worse. And so disappointing- the idea of fresh quality Mexican food could have been so good.",1
1476,"Flies, flies, and more flies!

It would be 5 star for take out because you wouldn't have to deal with flies.  But since it's a food truck, it's all outdoors and the flies are annoying.",3
1477,We tried this for the first time tonight. We decided to go early to try and beat the dinner crowd and unfortunately they were already busy and we had to sit in the front patio area. It would have been nice to see the entire restaurant. Fortunately the server was great and really knew the menu and actually assisted us with our selections. We started with the deviled crab appetizer. It was a small portion but was really tasty.....make sure you use the lime. I had the salmon and it was fantastic. My husband had the shrimp and grits and he said it was just a little bit spicy and tasted great. We look forward to returning to try some the other menu items.,4
1478,"Service, if there are more than two or three customers, tends to be chaotic and inefficient, a little amateurish, although reasonably friendly. The clientele--the people who come banging through the front door (consider fixing the door so that it opens and closes easily)--can be boorish and uncivilized. I have at times felt uncomfortable around them. The interior looks unfinished, and has a threadbare feel. I feel like a few tweaks--I don't know: fresh paint? a few pieces of new furniture?--could make the place a little less uninviting. The location is unfortunate, there on Chelten just off Wayne, steeped in the exhaust fumes of fast-food franchises and with everything around rather depressing, but that's not Enterprise's fault.",2
1479,"Disclaimer, I love RL, it's one of my absolute faves, but something has gone awry with this location and sadly its the only one near by. Every time I go here, it's like they're trying to set a new pace for dinner because they serve it so slow that by the time I get my food, I'm no longer hungry. Plus the food never looks like the ads, it always looks like it's been under a hot lamp for hours, which is odd since it took so long to come out. They always seem to put a lot of salt on their food. The servers are never sympathetic. They also rarely give refills unless I ask, this goes for bread and drinks. They're lucky they have that bread, because that's the only reason I come back!",3
1480,"We have tasted several menu items and were super satisfied every time.  The lasagna is really good and the red sauce has what it takes.  Italian sub sandwich is one of the best I have had, and I have had many!  Meatballs are from a good basic recipe but add the sauce and Mama Mia!  Parm sandwiches are super tasty as well.  All of the food is enough to share, but don't.  You'll regret it.
Also has some deli items and salads available.  Lots of imported olives and those wonderful Italian cookies for dessert, or antipasta in our case!  Some dry goods available, olive oils, imported canned goods.
The counter service makes our visit complete.  Employees are busy but focused and super accomodating.  Owner works his ars off like everyone else which I find a plus.  They even bake their own bread!  So good!
We really like this place.  Very clean and has a few tables for dining in.  Order big, there's always tomorrow!",5
1481,"Terrible customer service!  Nice, beautiful Sunday afternoon, we wanted to sit outside, have a drink and eat a late lunch.  The hostess took us to our table which was in the sun (all the other tables were under the pavilion in the shade) and there was a table with young kids right next to this table.  We wanted a nice quiet lunch to ourselves since it was a day without kids for us. We asked to sit on the other side where it was quieter and it was in the shade.  We were told we could not sit there because there was no server there.  I asked if the server could maybe walk two tables over she said no.  We went inside and asked for a manager and we were directed to the same hostess yet again and was told they didn't know who the manager would be that we need to talk to.  We were so excited when we walked up because it was the perfect atmosphere on the perfect day to be outside.  Needless to say we did not stay and will never go back.",1
1482,Great Margaritas.   Fresh Guacamole is perfect.   The menu interesting and food well prepared.  Good service.  I need to come early because I can't stand the LOUD noise from the diners.,4
1483,"Not bad! I got a burrito with salmon and it was a yummy, salty mix of flavors. Sushi burritos have a collapsability about them that makes eating them a bit more challenging, which I find entertaining. 

The burrito a rather underwhelming size (compared to the giant logs of food you get from regular burrito places) and the flavor of the fish didn't blow me away (compared to the flavors you might experience at a serious sushi place, or an expensive piece you get from a good grocery store). 

It was acceptable and satiating, but it felt like most of my taste bud reactions were coming from how they spiced and/or marinated their ingredients, rather than the freshness of the ingredients themselves. For the $10+ price, which made me feel like I was splurging a bit on an extra-exotic burrito, it didn't feel like I got much more food value than a regular burrito. 

However, I had a really nice server ! It's always interesting when the people are both charismatic and attentive. Their bowls looked larger and more impressive, so I'll see how their bowls are next time!",3
1484,"I spoke with Mike Almond this morning and was told the vehicle needed to be returned and scheduled an appointment to return it at 2pm.  I was told that they would be waiting and a check would be ready.  I arrived a few minutes late due to traffic and guess what?  Not ready as promised!!  I'm still sitting here waiting.  I was told that a check had to be cut and sent down from finance.
Are you seeing a pattern here?  

I have yet to receive anything promised.

Save yourself a massive headache and go elsewhere!  This place is full of your stereotypical salesmen.  No wonder car sales have such a bad name.   My time is valuable and they are disrespectful.
I will be so happy when this is all over!!",1
1485,"The best auto service experience I've ever encountered! This family-run business really takes care of your vehicles AND you. They'll even pick up and drop off your car or truck if you make an appointment. Their work is excellent and they're friendly with competitive prices.

Take your vehicles to Buckley's for a first-class service experience.",5
1486,NEVER. AGAIN. ever. again. charged me for my nails that i have never been charged that much in my life. said she has the color that she wanted but wasn't the color in the slightest. seriously never again.,1
1487,"Horrible coffee experience. The coffee is OK, I've had better. 

But what is REALLY annoying about this place is that when you walk in, you have no fucking idea where or how to order. You have to go searching around for a menu, a cashier station, etc. and figure out where and how to order. Trust me, having to figure all this out at 8 in the morning BEFORE YOU HAVE HAD YOUR COFFEE is NOT FUN.

Then they take FOREVER to give you your coffee. I don't know what the guy was doing back there: solving mathematical equations, developing a cure for cancer, masturbating? Because it took him at least 15 minutes to make 1 ounce of espresso. Are you freaking KIDDING me?

Nice lounge area, with cool music playing and the obligatory coffeehouse hipster chick manning the cash register.

But if you can't take my order and give me my coffee quickly, you lost me.

Bye-bye.",2
1488,"The ambience and decor were nice. The nachos were good, along with a few choice options. However, do not order a cheeseburger. It is not only tiny, but it looks like something that was dropped off the back of a McDonald's truck as it was driving through a bad neighborhood. It was over cooked, dry, and just plain nasty. I was very disappointed to find such a flop in a restaurant that seems to be filled with blockbusters. The overall experience was fine, but that burger sure did ruin it.  The fries were another disappointment all their own.",3
1489,The juice bar is now open and they have added some additional cardio and weight equipment.  This includes a leg press/sled and a pec/delt fly machine that are very nice.  The only issue now is the temperature upstairs... What is going on with the A/C?  Overall a very good gym!,4
1490,"I last reviewed this place three years ago when the host at Ru San's refused to seat my family (with small child) on a not very busy early evening.  I actually avoided the place for some time and had long wasabi laced affairs with places like Fujiyama in West Nashville.  

I recently returned for a late nite bite with a boy and it was significantly mediocre to warrant an update.  Like my crumbling relationship, RuSans chokes itself on sad attempts to dress up what was always low quality.  The washed out party techno and poor lighting is like being in the expositional scene of a romantic comedy set in New York. But not in the good way. The bloated menu is utterly ridiculous and stopped impressing people in 2004. The sushi, like our attempt to still enjoy sharing a meal together, was just pathetic. 90% rice, soggy seaweed, and overloaded with a sweet sauce.

I'm breaking up with you (again) RuSans. I wish you the best but I'm afraid that the Gulch is a big sea and there are plenty of other fish.",1
1491,"Trivia night on Thursdays is pretty rad...if you're into sports and 1980s pop culture...or are just out to consume the widest range of beer in the shortest amount of time in a sort of down-home restaurbar environment. (Think Cheers + Applebees.)

The real problems with Gullifty's are outside. The porch-deck-bar-thing has a grill, but the menu is limited to beefy delights. Vegetarians and inebriated college students would be sad to discover that sweet potato fries are not served outside. Drunkards would be sad to find that Guinness is not available outside...nor are all of the other wonderful beers that makes Gullifty's inside so awesome. 

You could always have a Coors Light, but only after they run out of Blue Moon on tap...or you could pay $10 for a mediocre organic strawberry cider that you drink 1) to offset its high price and 2) to get drunk enough that you feel good that you just bought organic and that your inner hippy is happy.",3
1492,"Hel-lo, Schlafly! Was in STL for the day and wanted to take my newly-turned-21-year-old-sister to a brewery. Being the day after Christmas, other breweries in the area were closed (I won't drop any names) so looking for a quick alternative, I stumbled upon Schlafly. I didn't know much about the brewery itself, I knew my STL classmates from college always ordered Schlafly at the bars and I found out quickly why so. It's comparable to Boulevard (reppin' KC!!) though smaller in size and production. We stopped in for a tour (tours start at the top of the hour) and it was the quickest brewery tour ever! No complaints here, considering that meant we got to the tasting quicker! The tour was super fast (as I mentioned) and we literally just walked back and forth in the back production area while our tour guide (who was very knowledgable, witty and interesting) gave us a quick rundown of their plant and how beer is made. The coolest part (as always) was the tasting at the end of the tour. We tried their Oktoberfest, Summer Lager, Export IPA and lastly (by request of another tour member), their Coffee Stout. The Coffee Stout was delish and my sister's favorite out of the ones we tried. The tasting was super chill and casual, very intimate with our small tour group all of which I enjoyed. Afterwards, my sis and I bought some souvenirs (wish they had a better packaging system for their souvenir glasses, we just had them put into a 6-pack container and were sent off). Souvenirs were decently priced. I saw they had a restaurant in the building but didn't get a chance to check it out this time around. I'm happy we stumbled upon this little gem. Loved it!",5
1493,"The waiter really saved the meal.  He was wonderful.  We ordered frites, which were great, and the calamari which was great (not the marinara-next time I will order without).  We ordered pizza with speck which was good but super salty (and I love salt).  The saddest thing was the campanelle with pepper and cheese.  That is so easy to make.  The pasta was really overcooked; just lay in a pool of cheesy oil; it was so salty as to be inedible.  The waiter understood just by looking at it, and he took it off our check.  

We wish them so much luck after the St. James closed.  We tried St. James three times and the food was fine, but the servers had such attitude and lack of knowledge of how to care for patrons. The food just couldn't overcome the pretentious attitude and weird seating (like there would be only two couples in the dining room and they would seat us at a two-seater right next to other couple - really?)   You do want to go there to relax.

We will continue to support this restaurant.  But the menu is really not rocket science - simple is very good, but it has to be done well.",2
1494,Decor and theme of the restaurant is great. We had the nachos appetizer - it was really good. Pulled pork wasn't the best I've ever had. Sides were really good. Kind of on the pricey side for bbq.,3
1495,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night just passing through.  We were traveling cross country pretty much so we didn't get there until late (4 am).  Make sure you read past the ""parking is never a problem"" on the website and note that valet service is $26. You read that correctly, $26 for parking.  Luckily, there's a parking garage across the street that you can park in for $3-$8.  Their website advertises that there is someone at the front desk ""24 hours a day"" but we had to wait several minutes before an employee came to help us.  I had called earlier to let them know that we weren't going to be in until late and the associate I spoke to assured me they had plenty of rooms and it wouldn't be a problem and hurried me off the phone.  The associate at the front desk when we arrived seemed surprised to see us checking in so late and mumbled something like she didn't see that we called for late check in.  

Anyway, we ended up getting a room on the 18th floor, which we asked for, so that was nice. It also had a pretty good view of the arch. The hotel is definitely outdated. The carpets are stained and worn down.  Honestly, the whole place looked dirty once you got past the lobby.  One thing they definitely have going for them is the size of the rooms, they are very spacious.  The bed was pretty comfortable as well.   Luckily, I got a great deal on a third party website and paid about half of what the rate normally is.  This made it more worth the money. 
 
The service wasn't great.  It seemed every time you asked someone a question they pointed you to the next desk.  Check out was quick and easy and we hit the built in Starbucks on the way out, which was definitely a nice way to start the day.  I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you get a really good deal on the price.  Besides the location, this hotel doesn't have much to offer.",3
1496,"It was ok. I wasn't all that into the buffet. The food was bland, however,  it was fresh. I loved the history photos on their walls and I love the tile designs on the ceiling. Food was just ok and bland my waitress was normal. Very small inside so grab your seats when you can.",3
1497,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED : I really can't say enough good things about this place. The pizza is thin cut and big slice style. I've had several different kinds of pizzas here and never have been disappointed. The wait staff is typically friendly, attentive, and helpful. 

Their hours are probably one of the biggest positives. Friday and Saturday when you come home from a game or need a late night food fix, they usually are open until 12-1. 

In terms of the beer garden.. I'm not much for going somewhere for simply beer so another review may she more light there.

In terms of how late they are open, the amount of options they have, and the quality of the food... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4
1498,"My friend really, really, really wanted to check this place out... We drove thirty minutes to get there. It wasn't great. The customer service was non existent (you need to ask for a menu, they hardly speak English, making ordering difficult), the food was meh, most things don't have any context/explanation of what the hell it is. It honestly reminded me of the quality of a food cart.",2
1499,Every thing was heavy and overly salted. I had only one night in phily and regret wasting my time and money here. Octopus probably was the worst ku treated! Soaked in oil and salt! I can not recommend this restaurant!,2
1500,"Sitting at Jiffy Lube getting an oil change making me think of my car... Which makes me think of Carl's.

The owner's name is Mike and him and I go way back. One of the few people I still like after giving them about $5k. 

This man will tell you like it is. What you can wait to fix, what you need to fix, and when it might be time to throw in the towel (he told me if I need another big repair I should part ways with my VW).

He truly has done all the major repairs on my car.

And he is a really nice guy. He once did a free oil change because I had just spent so much. Last time? I had him replace the wires, coils, and shock plugs in my car and it was raining outside. I live about a couple miles away and Mike offered me a ride. When I turned him down he gave me his own umbrella. 

Which is pretty fabulous service. Service you probably wouldn't get anywhere else.",5
1501,"Bottom Line:  Way overpriced, I think, for what it is.  Nothing stands out here.

My friend and I had the spinach and artichoke dip.  It was not bad, but a bit heavy on the cheese.  I was happy they serve the appetizer with both tortilla and pita chips (toasted, I believe).  I think I like the pita chips best.

The hamburger and fries I had were just OK.  I had the ""Saint Louis Blues"" burger because I was in the mood for blue cheese.  It had bacon on it, as well.  Just kind of ""the usual"".  

The bill came, and that is what kind of punched me in the chest.  Two beers (Bass Ale), appetizer, and entree came up to $30 sans tip.  

Gordon Ramsey has mentioned that a restaurant with a big selection on the menu is a warning flag.  It seems like when a restaurant does too much, it can't keep high standards on everything.  I have to agree and this place throws that flag.  

I will go back to CJ Muggs, if it is convenient, but I won't be having a full meal.",2
1502,"Visiting New Orleans for the first time... my sister had a taste for oysters and we found this place here, so we decided to try it.... turned out to be amazing. I order oysters, crab mac and cheese, and southern greens, everything was delicious!!!!",5
1503,"This is the worst place to eat! I love barbecue and the pulled pork was so dry I had to drown it in barbecue sauce to try and eat it! The wings were so dry, the collard greens were so bland that I had to put buffalo sauce and salt to make them taste somewhat decent. The food came out slow and we were starving. It was edible, that's about it! Had to place a order to go at tarpon tavern because I was still hungry after eating what little I had!",1
1504,So far I've been sitting here wanting to dine in for about 30 minutes and have yet to see a waitress. Had to finally get up from my table and go order a pizza and drinks from the front counter. There are two waitresses and about 5 tables of families. The waitresses are lazy and would rather stand around talking to friends than wait on a table. The girl just told the next family that came in here that it would be a better idea if they ordered to go than to dine in! LOL what a joke! This place is crap. Don't bother trying to eat here. Get delivery instead.,1
1505,"Wonderfully friendly and helpful staff, excellent manager. Everything we could possibly want, right around the corner!",4
1506,"i was here a long time ago when we were camping at Carpinteria State beach but it's been some time and couldn't recall how the food was.  We stopped by for lunch,  got here early around 11:15, good thing because the place was packed by 11:45. We started off with chicken sate.  The chicken was full of flavor and the peanut sauce was delicious. 
The lunch specials were priced fairly at $8.99 and the portions were large. I had the spicy fried noodle, my one daughter had the cashew nut chicken, my other daughter had the pad prik tia dam with shrimp and my wife had the prik king. All the dishes had a lot of flaver and were each unique. Presentation was very nice as well.
The inside of the restaurant is small but quaint.  They also have a nice patio area.",5
1507,"I wasn't going to dis this place until I went out to California a few weeks ago and had the chance to compare taste and price and then I decided to write this. I went to Home Wine Kitchen with my wife and another couple and we all ordered different entrees. We were told by our server that the menu changes weekly. I ordered the pheasant and when it came, it looked like a half chicken on white beans. Try as I might, I couldn't cut through the skin and get any meat. Everyone else, fortunately, ordered fish, pork or steak. They were enjoying their meals while I was trying futilely to dissect this bird. After awhile, I quit. The server asked me how I liked it and I said it was not cooked enough to be done. She took the plate and returned to inform me that the chef had told her that it was cooked properly. She didn't ask if I wanted something else, no apologies, etc. I noticed that a diner at the next table was attempting to cut through his pheasant with about the same luck. I asked if he were a surgeon because that's what it would take to get through the tendons, ligaments and muscle. Our portion of the bill was $140 for 2 glasses of wine, one shared appetizer, 2 entrees and one shared dessert. After a week in wine country in California where I wined and dined for less with exponentially better results, e.g. Domain Chandon (chef is up for best in America award) for $120, it is time for these pretentious ""wanna be"" cooks to realize that they don't really know what they are doing. And their Farm to Table, organic, sustainable bullshit is great except it doesn't replace good old fashioned culinary know how. Home? I think not. Next time I'll stay there.",1
1508,"I was out with my girlfriend. Although the food was good, the waitress was horrible We first ordered 1 soda   and 1 ice tea, and 2 waters she didn't bring us the water for another 15 minutes after we got the soda and ice tea.

When we asked for 2 minutes-, that turned into 16 minutes We actually had to wave down the Hostess and ask where our waitress went so we could order. When  the host asked the manager where she was, he got her. The waitress came over to take our order Nothing- not even an apology or smile.. Not a ""Sorry for the wait""

We ordered the Zuccini Frities, Chicken,Veal Parm. Food was all good. Bread was good.  We order the small portions. she screwed up the order- She brought us the regular sized ones. I made sure she didn't charge us for the regular ones - She in fact did and didn't take it off till the last moment- probably trying to sneak it by us hoping we wouldn't see so she would get a bigger tip.

She never came over and asked how our meal was. she never looked over to our table ONCE.After i got my meal i needed a drink refill. once again she disappeared for almost 15 minutes

It was around 3pm on a Sunday- there were plenty of servers, waitresses on the floor that night The restaurant was NOT packed. There was NO wait for our table when we arrived.And it it wasn't dinner hour yet. Our waitress appeared to be working only 4 tables in total.If it was any other restaurant That waitress would be catering to our every needs quickly and professionally with a smile on their face.

I have been to many restaurants and 90% of them have better service than this.

The food was good but I would rather stay at home than deal with this sub par and rude service.

She messed up the order was late with the drinks, never apologized and disappeared alot 

Trust me guys, go to a better class area than Springfield or dont be surprised if you walk away disappointed with the service.",1
1509,"The place is impeccably clean and the services was very friendly. I was so looking forward to having some good Indian food, but this place was a big disappointment. It says fast-food Indian food, but it basically was like eating frozen Indian food that had been warmed up in the microwave. I'll keep looking.",1
1510,"Had dinner here on our first night in St Louis.

Shared the toasted ravioli as an appetizer. Good stuff.

The main course was a medium rare porterhouse steak for me and the rack of lamb for the little lady. Sides were four cheese potato Au gratin and a baked potato, plus the house salad. Good stuff.

Finished it off with an Italian custard with fresh fruit and a rum raisin ice cream. And a cappuccino. All good.

The service was very friendly and attentive. Maybe too attentive. As we fished one course, they immediately brought out the next. Fast service is normally great, but come on, gives us a little time to digest between courses.",3
1511,"A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings! Clean, trendy, and delicious! I definitely recommend going early (before 9 am) as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am! But honestly, it is soooo worth the wait. You will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied!",5
1512,"Pretty darn good happy hour specials going on here.  Had an LIT (which I hadn't had in years) 2 for 1 $5 and $3 appetizers.  We drank & ate like crazy and our bill was less than $20.  

I am not cheap but the apps were pretty good & drinks weren't weak.  

Went back a 2nd time for dinner . . . .Short Rib Mac n' Chez - OMG!!!! Delish!!!",3
1513,"I won't be returning here. The waiter seemed overwhelmed and not as attentive as he could have been. The food took roughly 35 minutes to finally come, and when it did, it was lukewarm. By that point, our table of 7 was so hungry that no one wanted to bother returning their food and waiting longer. I did bring this to the attention of the manager who offered comp drinks and to remove one of my friend's items from the check. That was little consolation, however, to the underwhelming experience had here. I hope they are able to work on being more efficient, because I did not have an enjoyable time here at all.",2
1514,"Don't book a reservation on yelp! They'll trip over you to please you when you arrive!  Overkill at least 5 waitstaff interrupted us all evening to the point of annoyance.  And yet they jammed our party of 5 adults in the last possible table in the back room right next to a family with small children in an otherwise empty dining room.  

Bruschetta and salad great.  Food plentiful.  Wished they cooked the pizza a little longer. Very crowded tables. Jammed bar side. Complimentary Limoncello mini dessert shots were a surprise. 

Fyi...Happy hour applies to bar and outside only.",3
1515,"I was introduced to this place while on a business trip.  It's located in a small town and seems to be one of the few big diners around there.  It's a nice family style restaurant which serves up a variety of dishes suitable to satisfy all palates.  The service is very friendly and fast, regardless of how packed they may be.  Try their many homemade dishes.",3
1516,"This was our 3rd visit in just over a year and nothing has changed. Construction everywhere. Please sync your lights and let the traffic flow. 

Your drivers are horrible and I'm talking about just the Snowbirders. People of every age and race had a problem finding their accelerator on their vehicles. 

We love the area but would rather drive in LA than Tucson any day.",2
1517,"Food was okay, not exactly what I was looking for. But it was tasty. Service was good as well. We were just leaving as the salsa lessons began. Now that look like lots of fun, I will have to return and see how that goes!",4
1518,"I love this place!!!! best hot dogs in Tucson!!! sadly i don't go anymore because i dont ever carry cash with me and from time to time they accept credit cards but last time i was there, they had to turn my business down because i had no cash.",4
1519,"If your looking for something different, some place unique to eat this would be it. So, you mix ice cream with a great atmosphere, friendly staff and booze-you have a winner! We pulled up to the location thinking, what? This seemed a diamond in the rough until you walk inside. Place is full of happy customers, hearing several rounds of happy birthday being sung.  Lots and lots of choices on the menu. Ice cream was yum! Food even yummier! (Not a word, but going for it!). Was seated quickly. You blink and the waiter was there to answer questions about the menu. Which I asked plenty. They have a a whole different menu I have ever seen in an ice cream parlor. Best to say, if your 21 and older a must to try. Because they add liquor to their ice cream. Or is it they add ice cream to their liquor. I'm going with second statement. This place was just cool. 
Different blends of ice cream I've never tried before. Wished I could have sampled it all. Great staff, ice cream and food arrived very quickly. On top of the waiter several other staff members talked to us. Very open and friendly. I'd love to give this place another star if I could. Was that good!",5
1520,"The ambiance and live music here is fantastic. The band was pleasant and not overbearingly loud.

However the whole ""you have to be out in 1.5 hours"" is a major turn off. I could understand if people were sitting around not ordering but if you're ordering food and drink that makes no sense.

The food was decent but nothing to write home about. The service however was terrible. Since everything is served tapas style the food comes out as it's ready. Unfortunately my tacos took so long that everyone was finished eating and I still didn't have my food. 

Then I saw the table next to me (which arrived 30 min after us) served not one but two taco plates. When I asked the server what's going on, she gave me a really bitchy attitude and acted as though she was talking to a child. She goes ""yeah like I said the kitchen is backed up."" To which I said yes but not enough She did take them off the bill but her attitude was so off putting and condescending I didn't even care at that point. 

The tacos still took another 15 min after that. 

Also they have 2 different websites with different menus which is confusing. I went there based on one menu and got something different. Annoying.",1
1521,"Delicious burgers and milkshakes.  I highly recommend the gyro burger! Fun, loud atmosphere.",5
1522,"So far, it is the best Japanese place I've found in St. Louis. I'm slowly trying all of the good and cost effective Asian places I can find. Maybe they're lacking a large Japanese community, but there aren't too many other options. 

Walking in, I knew this one had promise with plenty of Asian employees and customers. Their menu had many of the appetizers and traditional dishes I crave in addition to sushi. Their takoyaki was a bit different than I've had anywhere else. It better featured the octopus which the dish is named for (Though I may prefer the toasted shavings of possibly scallops? Other places put on top).  The nigiri sushi was excellent in flavor. Though the squid had entirely too much wasabi underneath. Perhaps Japanese customers prefer it that way, but it doesn't go well at all with subtle squid flavor. The maki (rolls) were pretty good. Each one had a thorough description and much of the menu had pictures. 

I'll definitely be back for yakisoba, unadon, and more delicious meals! It seems great for people who like Japanese cuisine!",5
1523,"The wife and I were in town with some friends for NYE and paid this place a visit.

We stopped by for the happy hour and turned out to be the best food decision of the trip!  50 cent oysters....can't beat it!

The wife normally isn't a big fan of oysters, but managed to scarf down a dozen herself which is saying a lot, since normally she gets grossed out after the 3rd oyster.

Service is great.  The only knock on this place is that it's a bit small and there's a wait...but this is one of the few places where the food is definitely worth the wait!!!",5
1524,Cute coffee shop with lots of room and space. Free wi-fi. Cheesecake was great. They had specialty alcoholic coffee drinks for $5. I didn't think mine was that great but I suppose it's more of a novelty drink.,4
1525,"Despite reading these poor reviews, I still went by here because it was the only place I could find in SB. 

I can only repeat others recommendations not to go.

I went in on a Tues for new linings in my shoes. Was told to come back on Friday, and that it would be $25 (seemed a little high but I have little experience with shoe repairs).

Returned Monday to pick up the shoes - spent 10 mins waiting around while they randomly and idly perused the shop looking for my shoes. They had no idea where they were. Finally 10 mins later they found them, and they hadn't been touched. I took them back and walked out.

Nuff said.",1
1526,"The service was the most outstanding part of our visit. The pizza, however, was a bit mediocre. We ended up paying $55 for 12"" deep dish, one beer and 2 glasses of sangria (including an 18% tip.) It didn't feel like a fair trade once we left the building. I ordered ground beef and green peppers on my half and was left wishing I had also ordered cheese, as there was barely an ounce of it on the pie. If you're prepared to drop half a bill on pizza, make sure your expectations are proportionately average.",2
1527,"Ok, I normally go for the crawfish & tasso white pizza, which is great, but tonight I opted for pasta.  Crawfish in a garlicky cream sauce, which I asked to have spiced up a bit.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Been going there for about 15 years, will always go back",5
1528,Great service and friendly staff. Highly mediocre food. Calamari undercooked and doughy. Spaghetti bolognese tasted like chef boyardi world there. needs improvement,3
1529,"We decided to try this place out since it was a new Pho place close to our house.  Probably not going back.

Food was ok...if you don't mind the noodles being a little over. Soup was not very hot and felt the prices were high considering how much food we got. My daughter ended up with a piece of bone in her spring roll.

Service was pretty dismal. We were standing at the door for a good 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  It took even longer for someone to come by and take our order. They couldn't even get the order right. The bean sprouts, mint, and lemons we had to ask for and trying to get their attention was pretty painful. It took another table across from us to get the server's attention to get these and forks for my kids.

I have never not tipped (usually no less than 10%), but these guys really made me consider not tipping at all...2 stars because the food was passable.",2
1530,"A friend told me I HAD to go to this place.  I will not go back.  A middle-age/older woman behind the counter was pretty unpleasant and demanding, despite that they weren't busy - there were maybe 2 or 3 customers besides myself.  She was unfriendly and patronizing during every ounce of my short-lived conversation with her.  For example, she seemed to think I was an imbecile for asking if they had plain cheese croissants (rather than ham and cheese).  Also, I asked for an iced coffee and she said they don't have iced coffee because ""we don't compete with Starbucks and PJ's.  We just don't do that so we only have regular coffee.  You'll have to go somewhere else for that sort of thing.""  I happily and politely said, ""No problem, I'll take a large hot coffee.""  She didn't acknowledge what I had said or respond at all to me and was instead helping another customer at the register.  Another girl behind the counter saw me standing there waiting and asked what I needed.  I told her I think I had ordered a coffee with the other woman but wasn't sure.  The older woman at this point sternly told me that she was taking care of my order, despite that she wasn't in the least.  

Customer service is important to me so I'd recommend going to PJ's or Starbucks, which flank the patisserie on either side.",1
1531,"This is the McDonalds closest to my home, but I will forever drive any distance to find another bc it's a terrible restaurant. Even though it's not politically correct to say ""I love McDonalds"", every now and again and during lent we go to McDonalds and this one is really bad. Bad food, always cold or wrong items.  Bad service, and no offense to anyone but I cannot even communicate with most employees bc they don't speak any ENGLISH!!  I do not know much Spanish either but when I'm trying to spend my money in Fishers Indiana at a business I at least expect to be able to communicate in some way!  Their service is the slowest from any McDonalds in this area!  My advice: pass on this location unless you have allot of time and can speak Spanish !!!!",2
1532,"I wasn't super impressed, but then again it is a campus area bar.

When I got there, the place was packed; there wasn't an empty seat in the house. But the crowd was pretty diverse in age from groups of college students to mid 40's adults.

About 1/2 an hour later, people started to clear out.  The service was slow though, since it took about 10 minutes to ask if I wanted anything at a 1/2 empty bar. Same with getting another drink; it took about the same amount of time before I realized I'd rather just leave than try to get their attention.

The music is pretty awesome, but it's not a dance type place. I've heard they have good happy hour specials, but I was so bored during the hour I was here, I probably won't be back.",3
1533,The burgers were very good very flavorful. I had the El Mariachi. As with what other reviewers have said the portion is not big. But I believe it makes up in flavor. I also have salted caramel ice cream it was very good homemade style. I do recommend the rooster sauce.,4
1534,"I've been here several times throughout the years. This year marks their 25th Anniversary- congratulations!  When I was a kid it was called Ron's School House, but they've changed the name. My family and I came tonight to celebrate my brother's birthday. We had a nice time, were seated quickly, service was friendly and attentive and we learned quickly that some of us should have stuck with what they are known for and not ventured into the extravagant choices of the menu. My brother got a Philly chicken cheese steak and a side of fire grilled vegetables, both of which he's had before and no complaints there. My Dad ordered an American meal- Chicken breast with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli and also a caesar side salad. He liked his meal. My mom and I both ordered the eggplant parmasean dish with a side of spaghetti.. the noodles were slightly overcooked and the marinara sauce was very bland. I tried doctoring it up by adding grated table cheese, it helped a little.. but no basil or any other spices or flavoring.. disappointed in that. The actual eggplant.. where was it? It was heavily breaded and the eggplant was so thin I practically had to get a magnifying glass out to see it. Also it was fried, and covered it cheese- the cheese was probably the best part. It was so heavy from being fried and breaded. One thing I did enjoy though was I got the butternut, nutmeg, pumpkin soup for an extra $2. The soup was hearty, filling and sweet.

If you've never visited Ron's, i'd recommend sticking to the Ovals- pizza, which is what they're known for. I enjoyed the soup too, so check that out. Prices range from $8-17 for lunch and dinners. They also have a bar which stays pretty packed. We went tonight for dinner around 6 and the bar was already full by then and the dining rooms were filling up fast.",3
1535,"I dig this place. Great Cobb salad. Great flatbreads. Amazing BBQ sandwich. Super solid ingredients, pretty good service and a nice cafe environment. Not the cheapest place in the world, but it has delicious food. Always worth it.",5
1536,"Went here for lunch today. Waited an hour to get in. After waiting for our food another hour, we found out they misplaced our lunch order from the manager. She offered us coffee/beverages while we waited for our food. Food portions were large, but food is probably 3.5 to 4 stars. Found out they ended up charging us for the coffee we drank as we waited an eternity for our food. Also, the waiter in training spilled water on my friend's foot. Ugh!",2
1537,"Everything is great about panda. I normally used to give 4 stars but Im taking one off since they took forever to serve the food for me. I was the only person at that time standing in line to order, the girl said she will be back in a sec but she turned up after 2-3 min and by that time the queue grew to 10 people.",3
1538,"This salon needs a better vibe. No music, no magazines, staff needs to be more welcoming and smile. More attention to detail needed. They do not offer a massage, which is always a nice touch. Tidy and clean.",3
1539,"Honestly this is my favorite place to get pizza but there are a few little issues that keeps me from giving it 5 stars. One is how much everything costs, it is worth it but I still feel like the only reason why I don't order there often is that sometimes the good stuff is around $30 for one pizza. My other reason is that sometimes the food will get to you undercooked and that is based on how many toppings it has since they seem to put  all the food items in the same oven for the same amount of time.",4
1540,"5 stars simply does not do this place justice. My fiance and I had dinner here tonight before we went to see Jerry Seinfeld at the Arlington Theater. We got there before our 5pm reservation without realizing it was still happy hour. We began by ordering a dozen oysters and 2 oyster shooters. The oyster shooter was unbelievable. The most delicious oyster shooter I have ever had in my life. It had Parmesan cheese on top which I had never had before, atop some sort of a spicy cocktail sauce, with 2 oysters including the liquid inside. I was amazed. We ordered two more. Then we went ahead and got the calamari.. and let me say, HOLY CRAP! Again, another pleasant surprise. Drizzle it with lemon and you're good to go. We then ordered the margherita pizza with extra cheese. Perfection. I had to cut myself off there, but my fiance ordered one final thing. The plate that topped off the evening, the white truffle shrimp pasta. I had a bite, and if I wasn't so full from the food we already had I would've absolutely ordered my own. The staff was so friendly. Our server was Riley, and she went above and beyond to wait on us. It was slower because of how early it was.. but I'm sure if it was busy, she would have been just as attentive! I told one of the staff it was my fiance's birthday, so at the end of the meal they brought him over complimentary salted caramel flavored scoop of ice cream with a candle in it which was garnished with mint. A nice touch. This place is classy, fresh, casual and elegant all in one. I am so happy to only live 40 minutes away from here.. as I will definitely be coming back for the oyster shooters during happy hour, and look forward to trying one of the salads and other delicious looking menu options.",5
1541,"Had a massage through groupon. My initial experience was terrible, and the worst massage of my life, but then I emailed the staff there and they're going to try to fit me in on another day. Hopefully this time will be better than the last!",3
1542,We enjoy eating al fresco because it is so quiet and refreshing. Indoor seating is great but it can get a bit loud. The food is great- salad is unique and delicious. My spouse gets the NY strip which he loves. I had the chicken cutlet which also was great!! We'll certainly be back on our next visit in April .,4
1543,"Awful. Super disappointed in this restaurant.  The enchiladas came out with huge chunks of chicken and it was cold in the middle! My boyfriend ordered the carne asada he couldn't even cut through it with a steak knife (THAT WE HAD TO ASK FOR THREE TIMES!!!) 

Our waitress was sweet but young.... in an establishment like this if you are going for top notch service you need to TRAIN young and unexperienced servers.   Its embarrassing when they have NO CLUE what the difference between a scotch or a bourbon is.  Not only that but cant make any tequila recommendations..... YOU ARE A TEQUILA BAR.....How is this possible???!More training would be obviously helpful.

Oh and might want to tell your servers not to tell their tables to write good reviews online and mention their names because the management PAYS them for every good review if their name is mentioned in the review!  I get that you are desperate for good reviews because your restaurant is awful..... but maybe just FIX your issues....food, service, knowledge and then you wont have to have your servers ask people to write nice and possible fake reviews so they can get a couple dollars under the table.  Work smarter not harder.

  A new GM would be an obvious great start!!",1
1544,"I'm home writing this review because the pool at the Y is closed, contradicting its schedule. This happens not infrequently, and is important because there are hardly any daytime lap swim hours, so that the lanes are jammed with 3 or 4 people trying to circle swim in each lane at the same time. Classes often intrude on lap swim time as well. Rec swim (kids' times) is also exasperating - you must stay with kids under age 7 in a small and confined area of the pool at all times and cannot lap swim. Every time we go we discover new rules from the lifeguard about this or that thing they can't do. Front desk staff is nice, at least. I've been a member for over a year and wish I could quit, but there aren't better options anywhere else nearby.",2
1545,"The blonde girl server was very rude and disrespectful. I asked her if there were any daily special juices and she said no, while the other server told the guests at the next table that there were. Felt like she just wanted to send me away as soon as I finished my food. Her attitude in general made me feel very uncomfortable and angry. The food was ok too. The tofu platter was a little too salty.",1
1546,First time I came here I'd say 4 star. This last time (last Friday) I'd have to say No star. Make sure you don't get Star. She pays more attention to the other customers  not in her chair and she soooo butched my hair but worst of all she did my eyebrows. I now have barely 1 1/2 eyebrows.,1
1547,"Food used to great years ago but getting really chintzy.  Beef with broccoli, thin tough pieces of beef, six slices covered in veggies.  Not many people, and seeing dirty aqarium while eating not indusive to fine dining,",2
1548,"Been to Cosi a few thousand times and the Signature Salad is a favorite.   Went to this one and they tried to tell me a white dressing was the one that goes with that salad.   When I told them I didn't think that was right, they argued with me.   Seems odd that every other Cosi in the world uses a different dressing.   Maybe they were out and just didn't feel like making another batch?  It didn't taste good  and I didn't go back.",2
1549,Ordered a pizza tonight for the 1st time. I asked for half plain half pepperoni and received all pepperoni. I also asked for well done and did not receive it but that's typical because nobody knows what we'll done means. Over all it was decent and am willing to try it again!,4
1550,"Thanks to another Yelper, I found Barnet Fair.  
Changing hairdressers is always risky & scary!  But I'm so happy with taking a chance and changing salons.
Their salon is beautiful.  Everyone is very friendly and beautiful!  
They have a liquor cart.  If I didn't have to keep my act together that day, I would've made myself a cocktail.
Melissa cut my hair.  Not only was she very sweet but she did a beautiful job on my hair.  Asian hair is a pain in the @ss!  And she did an absolutely beautiful job on me!  I'm so, so, SO happy with it.  I will be back!",5
1551,"Service was terrible, took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 40 for our food, which we ordered at the same time. Food was mediocre at best. Will never be coming back.",1
1552,Driest reuben sandwich ever.  Meat cooked well but sandwich overall lacked moisture.  They ran out of mayo and the cole slaw they gave us just tasted like it was soaked in vinegar.  Yuck.,1
1553,"It's really a 2 1/2 star review, but I'm still a little bitter.

So the beautiful wife and I stopped by Mojo tonight.  We were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated at a table that felt a little ""hidden.""  But, hey, there was another table in the section occupied, plus the hostess really seemed to put a lot of thought into where to seat us.  When we walked in, I did notice group of staff standing around the bar talking.  Strangely, I thought this was going to be a good thing -- lots of people to promptly bring us food and lots of drinks, right?

Wrong.

So, after being seated and given menus, we had enough time to memorize the menu.  I'm sure I'm just being a dick because it was like 10 minutes, but it wasn't that busy and the conglomeration of staff at the bar was fresh in my mind.

Finally, our assigned server stopped by, expressing surprise that we were there.  Apparently/allegedly, the hostess failed to tell him that he had a table.  At least when he asked how long we had been waiting, I told him ""long enough that we were a minute away from leaving.""

So, that unpleasantness aside, we started off with drinks.  I was glad to see that a decent selection of beers on tap (I went with Anchor Steam).  The wine list looked decent, but my menu only had half the list (it had the same page twice).  They do carry Green Truck organic wines and are reasonably priced (though it's not called Green Truck anymore, but I digress).

Anyway, we had (and I can't copy and paste from their online menu, so if you want more details, go look at their website):

Tuna -- it's fine, but nothing special.  If anything, the tuna was overshadowed by lots of salad and bread.

Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese with the balsamic reduction -- these were pretty good, but not mind blowing.

Garlic Chile shrimp and sexy grits -- the consensus was ""this is scampi over grits.  And I have no idea why they're sexy, unless the big chunks of tomato and garlic was part of the sexiness.  Or was that part of the shrimp?  I don't know.   Our server did bring out some bread to sop up the sauce, which was nice.  And the bread was hot, so there's a plus.

Chicken kabob (jerk chicken with Key Lime yogurt drizzle) -- with Cafe Natasha so close, I wish we hadn't gotten this.  It was OK, but the sauce was way too sweet.

It might sound like a lot of food, but the portions are fairly small.

Like any good bell curve, the end of the meal involved us waiting for a bit to get the check.  Oh well.

When we left, I couldn't help but notice that there were three servers chatting with the hostess.  It's just weird.  I think they need to utilize their staff better.  Or something.

I don't think we'll be going back -- there's nothing really too exciting going on here.",2
1554,Went and waited 2 separate days and on the 2nd they tell me they don't have the glass? WTF do not go to this place. You are treated like veal.,1
1555,Food came out cold. Cappuccino was ok. Server was able to add smoked boudin to my farmers omelette for $4. Given the other reviews i expected more. Service was slow. I'm sorry I fell for a tourist trap.,2
1556,"Really want this place to succeed,  
They are attentive, customer service oriented, etc.
Place is clean and bright.
I had really high expectations. Sandwiches were fine.  Didn't blow me away, but they were fine.
I probably need to try it a few more times to get a better sense...",3
1557,Great ambience. Went there for lunch with family. Good service. Very limited menu. Food was good. We had ordered several salads and Tuna Burger.,3
1558,These tacos are amazing and the price of the food is very reasonable. I actually don't love the atmosphere but I understand why it is what it is. Nashville has the theme of walking up to order and picking up your food and I suppose I'm just the type of person who wants to be waited on so it doesn't seem so fast food like. Overall can't argue with the great taste of the food. Plus they have mix and match bucket of beers!,4
1559,Painfully slow. Painful parking (but on state street) nails barely lasted for gel compared to other places. The lady that did my nails could care less about me. A place I won't be back to. Sorry.,1
1560,"Don't eat here! Worse dining experience I had in NOLA. To begin with, they're severely understaffed. This resulted in not only a long wait to order and be served your food at their lil bar stools, but also the food was cold. I had the jambalaya, which tasted like it was straight out of a Zatarran's box, which is fine if you weren't paying $10 for it. My mom had the grilled shrimp poboy. Much to her dismay the shrimp was not grilled and it was not large shrimp, but rather small baby shrimp. We never got a refill on our diet coke nor were we given water. Whatever you do, don't waste your money here at this tourist trap. There are plenty of other eateries to experience local fare",1
1561,Ask for Dominick!  You'll get dinner AND a show.  We had the best meal and he is hilarious.  The food is delicious as usual and the show was fantastic.  What a fantastic birthday evening with the family.,5
1562,"The name gives a clear picture of the type of food you'll have: yummy, rich, tender, and after you eat it, you'll feel very drowsy. I think I have taken or have tried to take a nap every single time after I got home from this place.
 
There is a lot to choose from on the menu (almost too much).  

The wait to get seated can be horrible on weekends, but once you're in, the place works like clockwork. The staff is friendly, isn't impatient, and gets you everything you want fast.",4
1563,We always have a really great time here! Lots of fun!! And the popcorn and unsweetened tea are really good,5
1564,"Express Scripts called me as they offer services through my insurance carrier. I was mistrusting at first, and then as I was on the phone I looked up the Yelp reviews-- I think it's the worst-reviewed company I've ever seen! But I decided to give it a shot anyway because it sounded convenient. I made my order. Nine days later a 3 month supply showed up in the mail for 50% less than my local pharmacy. Great, easy service.",5
1565,"When the kitchen is on, out comes perfect grilled octopus on a bed of the freshest arugula salad and tender medallions of  veal almost like filet mignon. Too bad the service can be sooooo slow.",4
1566,Do not visit for the food.  It's very poor quality.  In addition they don't have many gluten free options either.  Our group enjoyed having cocktails on the rooftop and that's all I would recommend.,2
1567,"I have been here previously and enjoyed it very much.   Last night, however, was a different experience.   Upon giving our reservation, we felt as if we had intruded into a private club and were not particularly welcomed.   Maybe regulars are treated differently?  The waitstaff did their job serving but seemed uninterested.  
I will say the food was good.  The gnocchi bolognese (which we split for an appetizer) was delicious as were the soft shell crabs.  Other upscale restaurants we have been to will split the appetizer onto two plates when sharing but they did not.
There are so many excellent restaurants in the area that provide a welcoming atmosphere that I don't see any reason to return here despite the food being good.",3
1568,"House of Beauty is an absolute sham, and possibly a scam!  I ordered products from them some years ago, and waited a ridiculously long time to receive them.  I decided to try them again recently, ordered my products online more than 6 weeks ago, and have received NOTHING!  No one ever answers their phone, and I have written several emails with no response whatsoever.  DO NOT order anything from these people, they are terrible!

1569,"Wonderful place in the heart of the quarter! Food, atmosphere, service and servers make your visit a special occasion and the only place to go for that special dinner!",5
1570,"Great music, excellent DJ and delicious food! Couldn't ask for a better bar in Channelside. Do yourself a favor and order the grouper cheeks and flatbread! Definitely will be returning.",4
1571,Due to no fault of my own. I ended up with a small dent in my car door yesterday. The management at Metro Car Wash offered to split the cost of repairs with me even though I had not complained or made a big deal out of it. I only had notified management of the potential for further guest to receive damage to their vehicles based on the new equipment they had installed. Metro Car Wash is the best car wash in Reno and their customer service is 5 star. They are currently working toward improving their vacuum stations and this issue is being resolved.,5
1572,"7:50pm on a Saturday. Terrible service. Been here 30mins so far and no food, our order was just taken. Took almost 20 mins to get a glass of wine. The wine selection is really small and I would not say good. The wine we picked it terrible. It seems like everyone in here is waiting for something. The food was good, however no one ever came to check on us. Like at all. We are still currently waiting for the waitress to come out. It is very awkward in here, considering my table and 1 other table of 2 are left. Watching everyone clean.",1
1573,"It's been a while since I've had a Vietnamese hoagie, so I was eager to give Nhu Y a try.  It's a tiny little closet of a space - so take out only.  They offer about 7 or 8 different options- two are vegetarian (one regular, one special).  I attempted to inquire about the difference between the two, but did not really get a good answer on this so went with the regular vegetarian (tofu) hoagie.  It took only a few minutes to make the sandwich and it cost me only $3.50!  I started eating the sandwich on the way home- the baguette is rather skinny, so it may not be enough food for some people, but it was a perfect sized lunch for me.  The sauce was a nice blend of tangy sweet- mixing well with the spice from the jalapeños.  The cilantro and shredded carrots were fresh, the bread was crispy and didn't get soggy at all from the sauce or tofu in the sandwich.  I wish there had been a bit more of everything in the actual sandwich, but then again, I ate the whole thing and I'm full.  I'm definitely curious to go back and try the special vegetarian hoagie next time.  Recommended for a very inexpensive lunch or snack.",3
1574,"TVs lots and lots of TVs. That is the good thing I can say about this place. The atmosphere feels big and open, the booths have a big huge Texas kinda feel to then. And boy does this place get crowded. The parking lot is not small, yet it seemed to be overflowing on my last visit for a Thursday happy hour. 

While the booths felt big and open they also were not very private. There was a family nearby so I had to be careful to watch my language. I snacked on stuffed olives and deviled eggs. Did not get a full meal. Drank a tall Budweiser, and overall had fun with friends. I do prefer sports bars with a less corporate feel, something more like Ferg's is downtown St. Pete. The menu did look fascinating, and while the food was not too expensive, it did seem a bit pricy for being bar food.

Overall this is a decent sport bar and everything was A-OK. My snacks were good, service was a tad bit slow, but understandable with how crowded it was. Not going to be chompin' at the bit to come back, but I would not object to giving this place another shot!",3
1575,"I remember being wheeled in the basket by my mother across this parking lot as a child 40+ years ago.  So happy that they are still around and better than ever.  Dorignacs has by far the best produce, meats and liquor selection and prices.  They also have hard to find items that you cannot find anywhere else. The bakery is amazing, the glazed donuts and canolis are the best.  They also have Turtles.  YUM! 
They are upgrading the layout and have recently given it a facelift to keep it fresh looking.  I also like that when you are there almost every isle is staffed with a checkout person.",5
1576,"Dinner was no good at all. Food was bland and they had very few options to choose from. The entertainment was not bad, but when buying a ticket make sure to only come for the show...but that kind of defeats the purpose of a dinner theater.",2
1577,"Went there today to look at minivans and not a soul talked to me. My wife and I have three kids and are busy-we plan to buy a minivan within the next 2 weeks and my wife thinks she really wants an odyessey. I checked it out in the showroom twice--opened the doors, sat in the seats, looked around. Was there about a half an hour. The whole time I was there, no one even asked if they could help me. I thought,  ""screw it, I'm out.""  Will go to Carmax or Toyota. My wife agrees.",1
1578,"This is a fun little bar that seems like it might be the kind of place to really let loose. I wasn't really in a karaoke kind of mood, but it was fun hearing those brave souls step up to the mike and give it their all. Props to the strong drinks!",3
1579,"Great place and location for the price. Nice rooms, pool, location and hot tub.  Will return",5
1580,So I'm torn here. The servers are good. I've gotten my eye brows waxed here and an acrylic fill. I liked the results but the place itself is dirty. Hair in the seats. Stains. Everything is white so there's stains everywhere and it's dingy. I go because it's close to walk to but I wish there was some place else,3
1581,"1) carpet is sticky 2) didn't give us enough towels 3) phone doesn't work to call down to front desk 4) we asked them to clean our room five times, never happened 5) asked for sheets and blankets for the pull-out bed at least eight times, never happened. Don't waste your money here.",1
1582,"I've been to Katie's on quite a few occasions, and overtime the food was absolutely delicious, but when I decided to go there for brunch for my birthday.. I was not happy with my experience. First off, I decided on Katie's because I was told they had bottomless mimosas. When I arrived, I had to seat at the bar until my entire party arrived.. there were about 6 of us. I asked the bartender if I could do the bottomless mimosa's, but she said you could only do that when you are seated at a table... FINE, I understand. When the sixth member of our party FINALLY got there and after our table was given away about 3 times, we were finally able to sit, which is when i realized that the people at the bar were drinking out of the bottomless glasses.. So after spending $20 over the price of the bottomless, since I was buying by the glass.. I wasn't happy. But what really set me over the edge was the absolutely RUDE red headed woman. A girl I was with got her steak that was suppose to be cooked RARE anti  was medium well. When we told the woman about the steak ordeal she actually said ""that's our rare""...... As if there is not a universal cooking scale when it comes meat. No restaurant has a different version of R MR M MW WD.. ITS ALL THE SAME. I've been back since and she is rude every time... Katie's, she's gotta go!",3
1583,"I want to give this a 4 (I am indeed a fan!) but I think I need to go back after this place has been open for awhile to reassess.

Upon entering, we were greeted by who I think was the owner or manager - a very dapper older gent sitting at the bar. He was really friendly and welcoming.

I thought putting the cocktail menu in the children's book was really cute, but I agree that it could use some work. I was also a little disappointed to see only a handful of whiskey drinks on the menu - I thought this was a whiskey/bourbon-centric speakeasy-esque bar? Nevertheless, I was overall pleased with my drink. I got the Branch Whiskey Sour and thought it was refreshing, if not a slight bit on the watery side. Funny enough, I don't like my drinks to taste like gasoline, but I wanted this one to taste a bit more boozey.

My boyfriend had their house Manhattan and loved it, though. I really think this place has promise! We'll definitely be back to check out a show in a few weeks, and I'm really hoping they'll work out the kinks quickly. It's pretty exciting to have a bar like this in the neighborhood.",3
1584,"I got bitten by bed bugs all over my body at this hotel. When I went to the front desk to inform the gentlemen who were manning the desk, there were absolutely no apologies or the remotest sign of remorse. They did, however, transfer me to a new room, which thankfully had no bed bugs. I would advise anyone who is not a fan of pest infestation and poor customer service to stay as far away as they can from this hotel. I personally know there is no way I will willingly go back.",1
1585,"Got around to checking this place out last weekend...  I agree with one person's comment about its nothing like satco - THANK GOD!  I'm not sure why another person said it was....  and another thing, the college kids/frat boys HAVE found it, but hopefully they won't make it one of their new hang outs, as I didn't see buckets of beer on the menu.  
So the line issue will hopefully figure itself out because I don't think its a great idea....  It takes people forever to order so the line doesn't move very quickly (though maybe thats just how it was the night I was there, and since its a new place people are unfamiliar with the menu and take longer) but if there are open seats at the bar, I'd run over there and grab them and you don't have to wait in line - you can place your order at the bar.... although then you have to eat indoors.  
The staff seemed very friendly and eager to serve, which was a good thing.
The menu was small and simple... which is also nice sometimes.  Too many options can make choosing difficult!  They have about 8 different soft tacos and I think also about 6 different enchiladas..  all the tacos are $2.50.  They also serve up some sides like salsas, queso, and guac - all for a good price of less than $4.  I think they also had some other items but since I was there for tacos, I didn't really read them.  The southern fried taco wasn't too exciting - just some fried chicken and a sweet sauce in a taco - so i'd pass on that one.  The korean bbq one I thought was really tasty - great flavor to it!  My boyfriend had the fish taco - he said it was good, but not great - and he also had the spicy shrimp taco which he said was excellent... and now wants to keep going back just for that taco - apparently its super super spicy so beware!
I liked the queso, I didn't think it resembled gross melted down cheese like someone else mentioned.  it was creamy and tasty.  served its purpose!
They also had an interesting drink menu - I'm gonna try the ""lojito"" next time I go - which was basically a mojito that uses a local rum in it.  
So all in all - I thought it was a great place - its super affordable, it can be quick if your timing is right, and they had some really interesting fun flavors instead of your standard boring tacos.  I mean ""Kelly P"" if you want boring standard tacos - then go to SATCO, or las palmas or whatever mexican restaurant you're used to going to - this place is for interesting flavors, proper portion sizes, good prices and quality food.  

Oh and they valet park - which I hate using, but its convenient when theres no parking spaces!

***** UPDATE ******

So I went back to Local Taco last weekend and decided to remove a star from my review.  First of all - the music they were playing was VERY LOUD.  Now - Loud music doesn't necessarily upset me, but I had to yell across the table to speak to my boyfriend during the meal!  YELL.  Not only that -  but the music they wanted to blast... was Maroon 5!!!!!  WHAT?? And not just a song - BUT THE WHOLE ALBUM.  I HATE that band - so it totally ruined my whole experience in there.  Why on earth would you play an entire album at a restaurant?  There is a reason for the radio or mixes... so your music can appeal to the masses... not single them out.  jesus.  it was terrible!
Ok so on top of the awful loud music - there were flies buzzing around us the whole time (and we were eating inside due to the intense heat outside)..  they were swarming our table.  Very unpleasant experience.
To top it off - about 2 hours later, both of us were experiencing sour stomachs..   
This really upsets me because I really really wanted to like this place, but after this last visit I don't think I want to return.",2
1586,"Never thought I'd be writing a positive review for a Dentist.  I HATE going to the dentist, but the folks at Dentex Dental are great!  They make you feel comfortable and are caring and professional.  Front desk staff are terrific and friendly and will always call you in the day before to remind you of your appointment.  One of the best dental experiences I've ever had.  I highly recommend them!",5
1587,"Ok, I hate to give a place one star and I generally don't do it, but after two visits within the past week and both of them being poor, I am left no choice.  On the first visit, an individual in my party (of three people) received their order incorrectly and the kitchen manager was going to fix it.  I believe she then forgot to turn in the order to fix it so everyone was done and the lady still didn't have her corrected order.  Our waitress didn't even return to our table the entire time we were there.  We had to flag down another employee for drink refills.  Second visit... waited...waited...waited... seriously, how long does it take to make a few pizzas, a salad and an app?  Then, we ordered dessert, waited about ten minutes for it.  The employee said ""sorry for your wait"" when he brought us the check and then we continued to wait another ten minutes for him to come back and pick it up.  If you are going to acknowledge our wait, you might not want to make us wait again.  Grr!  We were late getting back to our office from our lunch break.  Probably have to say with certainty that I won't be returning to CPK.  Sorry, because the food is actually not that bad but the service could use serious improvements because they are not even that busy of a place!",1
1588,Good coffee. Great cheesecakes and ice cream. Awesome to be able to walk / bike to get a cuppa.,4
1589,"A very nice hotel located just a few minutes away from the Tampa airport.  One of the better Hyatts I've stayed at.

Most of the hotel areas are renovated and has a fresh look.  The front desk check in and check out process was a breeze.  It could be because it was low season.   I didn't get to use the gym or pool but it would have been nice maybe the next time I am in the area again.  

Free wifi with my platinum Hyatt membership.  My meeting ran over and they were also able to extend my checkout time smoothly.

I also went there for a conference.  The conference rooms were nicely lit and maintained.",4
1590,"This is by far the best Japanese restaurant in the area. This was our first visit and I'm ashamed we have been missing out for this long. We were greeted with smiling faces and immediately seated. Our waitresses were outstanding they were friendly and jumped at every opportunity to make our dinner great. Before we could request anything they brought out exactly what we were looking for. 
We ordering the teriyaki chicken and teriyaki shrimp...both were brought out sizzling hot and perfectly seasoned. We also ordered the tornado sushi roll which was perfect.....likely one of the best signature rolls I've tried in years. This place is a diamond in the rough.",5
1591,"I came here for dinner. The service was okay, she hardly came around to our table. 

Beet salads (3/5) - The dressing was delicious with the pecan caramel. However, they need to chop those veggies smaller because when I eat the sauce would get all over my face. 
Fried oyster salad (3/5) - The best part is the fried oysters
Flammenkuchen (1/5) - Cheesy, salty and sweet....I did not like it at all
Cream brulee (4/5)

Overall, it was an okay restaurant. I heard their lunch/brunch menu is much better so I would come back to try their brunch.",2

1593,"I had a horrible experience here!! This is what happened.  I walked into the boutique and I was greeted by one of the sales associates who was sitting on the back counter.  I asked them a simple question and they laughed at my question and said to go somewhere else.  They didn't even pretend to give a crap. 
I've always bought my makeup there and I've spent hundreds if not more getting this brand. I think I will go check out their competitors.",1

1595,"An interactive mass produced chain restaurant! Hooray!! Order lots of meat. I mean, LOTS. Like a meat entree with 2 meat sides. You'll thank me.",4
1596,It was just okay to me. Kind of over priced. I paid 14 buck's for two smalls drinks. The register locked up and I had to wait 20 minutes to get my change. I was super frustrated and asked if I could do credit but the cashier said that she couldn't do it... I feel like I should have atleast gotten a discount or my drinks for free for the amount of my time that was wasted. Unfortunately I do not care to come back to this place.,2
1597,I was presently surprised by both the food and the service here. I ordered the gorgonzola gnocchi and my date had the pollo osteria. Both dishes were delicious and the portions are huge! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is very nice as well... good date spot. I will definitely return!,4
1598,"As far as good service goes, we started at the bar and had good service with a friendly bartender. Shortly after we moved to a table and the experience went sour. We were forgotten and then after finding a manager we were left again to wait for another hour before receiving our food. At this point we were late for the baseball game and wanted to leave. After receiving our food we found the meats overcooked and hardly saw our waitress. If you are looking for a slow place to wait for your food and you have no where to go this would be it. If that is not the case there are plenty of other places with better service and food.",1

The doughnuts are nothing special in my opinion. The texture was good but it's just your typical cake doughnut that can be made at home if you had a fryer. They were all the same doughnuts with just a different sugar or glaze over it. I tried four flavors but none of them particularly stood out to me.

The fried chicken wasn't bad. It was moist, but again, nothing to rave about. It comes with a honey doughnut but I didn't get any pickles as stated on the online menu. I had a dry topping and a wet topping. For the dry topping, I chose the coconut curry. It tasted more like regular curry powder dusted over the chicken with no hints of coconut.  And the chicken

1600,"Horrible food.  Bread sticks totally dry. Mozzarella sticks more salty than salt itself. And the worst tasting, bland, fettuccine alfredo ever.  Gave it a try despite the 1.5 stars but shouldn't have risked it. Wish I could give them a zero.",1
1601,Interesting bar. It was empty when we went in but it had a very cozy atmosphere. The drinks were cheap and it's a great place to relax and have a chat with someone. The decor in this place was really interesting. Everything to creepy paintings to mismatched lamp shades made this place stand out.,4

She's punctual, quick and did a great job grooming both toy poodles. She arrived exactly at 9:00 and was gone by 10:30. Both dogs are clean, smell nice, perfectly groomed and I didn't have to get out of my pajamas. LOVE her service!",5
1603,"Here's an update for my further Comcast experience. Our bill was increased to 250.00 a month. We called and removed some luxery items which brought our bill to 225.00 a month. Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered, as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. ""Nothing we can do"" was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden, they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately, it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation, customer service, and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don't care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service, yet I wouldn't take it on principle. Screw you Comcast!",1
1604,Worst of the worst. Ordered three items and waited 40 minutes for the barbecued shrimp to come out. Told me the others were on the way. 10 more minutes and a small plate of rice came out as the Jambalaya. Asked what was supposed to be in the dish- chicken and sausage. No sign of either (or the catfish Poboy).  Finally gave up and asked for a refund which took another 10 minutes and refunded the wrong amount- at which point we had enough.  Stay away!!,1
1605,"AVERAGE!

The only way to describe this place.  Had the sirloin steak salad, the meat was over cooked, huge inedible pieces, onions were the same (huge) but raw and not seasoned.  Also had the chicken tacos, which were under seasoned, dry and uninspired (also wayyy to big to eat without a fork).

2 drinks + 2 cheap entrees = $42

1611,"I have stayed here several times. The hotel is going down hill. It is one of the best in the city, but will not stay so if the trend continues. Here are some of its shortcomings for me on my last visit: 

1) Double booked in a suite and room. they wanted me to have the more expensive suite. 
2) Marginal HVAC. Overall not much a problem. I just opened the little fresh air vents below the windows and got enough cool, fresh air. 
But it all should work. 
3) Wake up call that never came. 
4) I had a three day stay, but the door was programed for only two. Had to traipse down to the lobby late at night. I hate that. 
5) Threadbare towels that have seen better days. 

One of my business associates declined three separate rooms at check in. One because the HVAC did not work and another because the whole 12th floor smelled of cat pee. He had many other problems and will probably yelp about them. 

The day I checked in Snow Patrol was playing a gig in Boise and the band stayed there. Not bad seeing the boys in the lobby. 

The shortcomings befalling this property should not be held against the lobby restaurant., Emilio's. Emilio's is outstanding and I will Yelp about that on its own.

I pick it out, along with a couple pieces of mushroom, when I asked for no mushrooms. I'm slowly eating at this point - pretty disgusted. I then find a second piece of bacon! I stopped at this point; I hadn't even finished half my scramble. 
She brings me the bill, and charged me for spinach and avocado that I had added, even though I asked for no mushrooms. Couldn't it had been a substitute somewhere?!
Awful experience, and it was my first time to clearwater (sucks I chose to eat there out of other places).",1
1614,"So upset I mistakenly booked this place instead of the Sofitel. I blame the app I was using. I've stayed here before and it was obviously not worth remembering or booking again. 

The beds are worn out and saggy. The decor and furniture are dated. The room smells stagnant and musty (21st floor). The bathroom is smaller than a broom closet. I'm glad I'm only here one night. 

Totally bummed.",2
1615,"My wife and I came in shortly after the new ownership took over and while I was pleased at how much cleaner it looked, felt, and smelled... I was really bummed that they took out half the taps and made that remaining selection pretty lame. It didn't help that the one beer I actually wanted they were out of. They also increased the prices of the 'schooner' fills (to the point where it wasn't even a tiny bit of a deal) and reduced the options of what you could put in them. Service was fairly slow, but not as slow as many of these other reviews have indicated.

I'm a beer-lover who strives to always try different things, so a diverse and changing selection is essential to me. I was already really taken aback by the significant reduction in choices, but then to rename the place as a Tap Room? What a slap in the face.

With HopCat across the street, The Pint Room just a hop over in Carmel, and TwentyTap a few blocks south in SoBro, I have literally no reason to ever go back. Additionally, The Sinking Ship only has 8 taps, but they are expertly managed and always have great things. Flat Water has a similarly small number of taps, but their food is anything but basic bar food.

I'm not really sure who the Village Tap Room is trying to appeal to, despite their claimed demographic of ""an older crowd.""",2

1620,"This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had filling a prescription. I have seriously considered paying out of pocket for my medicine or changing to a decent insurance company due to the inordinate amount of trouble I have been going through this past two weeks. 
I have been taking the exact same medication for years. All of a sudden I need ""prior authorization"" for it. No biggie right? Wrong. It has taken me TWO WEEKS of calling over and over back and forth with the pharmacy, doctors office and the insurance company to figure out how to get this approved. Express scripts keeps sending back my doctors paperwork and telling them I need to try something else first. No. This is why I pay insurance--so I can receive the medicine my doctor prescribes. Each time they reject my doctors paperwork, it takes a few days to restart the process. It is unfair for the nurses, doctors and pharmacy reps including myself to have to go through this. 
I loathe this company and once I get my refills I will make sure I do whatever I have to do to get away from them. You get what you pay for. I am calling BCBS and seeing what pharmacy programs they offer. This is the most frustrating and ridiculous experience I have ever had with an insurance company! DO NOT GO TO EXPRESS SCRIPTS!!!

He even gives large samples of his famous lassis, and I think the first time I came here he gave mine to me free! Definitely made me come back again and again. By now, I just end up getting the mango lassi because it's one of my favorite drinks (not too sugarly, but sweet enough to satisfy me and cold enough to refresh me). I usually bring a gluten free chaat back for my boyfriend, and while I'm not a big fan of chaat in general because of its spices I do enjoy nibbling a few bites off his plate, since all the ingredients are crispy and fresh. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is that it's slow sometimes to get your order when there's a line, because there is only one employee and he painstakingly makes each order by hand (and with a smile!), so it sometimes gets me a bit impatient..but I would not compromise the fantastic service for all the quickness in the world, because that's what makes this place so great!",4

1625,"Bleh. Big disappointment.

I've been wanting to come here for so long only to be so disappointed. The food was ridiculously overpriced, and the dining experience is extremely long (We probably got there around 7, and didn't get out til almost 11). There's just so much wait time that it's not really worth it.

For our first course we ordered two cheeses that comes with bread, apples, and a small portion of vegetables for dipping. The fiesta cheese was pretty good, however, stay away from the swiss. It's horrible. We tried to keep a good amount of cheese left to dip our entrees in, only to find out, we weren't allowed to. The cheeses had to be cleared for the entrees to come in. So that disappointed us too.

So then our entrees come, and to our surprise every thing was raw and you had to cook it in the broth and oil. It's like hot pot, but not very good. We didn't like that we had to cook ourselves because that only meant we'd have to stay in the restaurant longer. I ordered an individual entree, the seafood trio for $24. It came with tuna, shrimp, and scallops. It looks like a small portion but it's filling after the cheese and salad that comes with it. By the way, it was the most amazing salad I've ever had. I ordered the House salad and the dressing was beyond perfect. 

So anyway, I stuck with the broth because I didn't want to cook my food in the oil. It just didn't look good to me. They give you two kinds of batter, sesame and tempura, which can only be dipped in the oil so I didn't try it. They also give you a variety of dipping sauces - plum, some kind of yogurt, and another which was kind of like cocktail sauce. They also serve broccoli, mushrooms, and potatoes, which go really well with the butter cheese spread. 

We were definitely not leaving until after we had some dessert. We ordered the smores dip, which was flambé'd. It came with a variety of things - strawberries, bananas, rice crispies, cheesecake, little brownies that were so good, and marshmallows. The smallest pot was more than enough for 6 people, so I recommend sticking to one pot to save money. Same goes for the cheese.

All in all, I won't be going back there again unless we're strictly getting dessert only. Go if you have a lot of time and money, otherwise, it's not as great as people say it is.",2
1626,"The family and I stopped by this newly opened restaurant at Oaks on a Sat. at around 1pm.  Though it's peak lunch hour, it's rather quiet.  Despite that, almost everything is great!

Since the restaurant is new, the bath room is clean and in great shape, which a lot of restaurants around the neighborhood lack.

We chose the outdoor sitting.  The table and chars are in great shapes...  There's not single sight of bird dropping anywhere...one of the big No-No for outdoor dinning.

As for the food, we ordered from the 2 for $12 menu and got a  class Chicago pizza, vegi medley pasta and chicken parmesan.

The pizza was great...just like Uno used to make.  The crust was crispy, but not doughy.  The sauce is not too salty...however, the sausage is a bit gamy...this could be that they didn't put enough seasoning in the sausage.

The pastas were great.  The chicken in the chicken parm is thin and has a thin crispy parmesan crust.  The meat was cooked just right.

The wait staff does need more training about the common courtesy, but that would just icing on the cake!",4

1630,"Is there actually a good place to find breakfast in Nashville? My wife and I tried two places, and they were both marginal. Prime 108 was one of them.

Looking at the ratings from dinner-goes, I'm sure Prime 108 is a fine place to have a steak, but for breakfast it left a lot to be desired. Let's start with having to stand in line in the lobby for about twenty minutes while the hostess takes her sweet time escorting people to their tables, then going to chat with some of the waiters for far too long before coming back for the next guest. Mind you, that's tolerable when the restaurant is packed, but when I can clearly see that there are at least 10 empty tables from my place in line behind four other groups (with two other groups behind us), that kind of lethargy in seating guests is unacceptable.

The food and service from the waiter were also nothing spectacular. Our waiter was nearly as slow as the hostess and every time he approached our table he looked like he'd rather be anywhere else than working in that restaurant. Beyond that, the quality of the food was average at best. Particularly disappointing was the tartness of the fruit in the compote. Probably should have been checked before serving it to guests.",2

I got a Western Omelette with just egg whites, and it came with seasoned potatoes. The omelette was a little watery, but the potatoes were pretty good. The seasoning was almost like an Old Bay type thing. 

Maybe it's just the time we went, and maybe I will give them another chance, but as for now, we will keep searching for that late-night-south-jersey-gem.",3

People coming in, people shopping, and people leaving were all running into each other. Although the staff did their best it was very frustrating. We attempted to do a little shopping and got in line to pay but it took so long we got disgusted and left. Won't be back for awhile.",2

The Mole (which is a flavor that can easily be mutilated) taco was amazing.  Finally an authentic taco in Indiana.  It was packed with fresh, tasty ingredients and the sauce was fantastic.  I will go back and try the other tacos, if I can get past the Mole, skipping the steak of course.  2 to 3 tacos would make for a filling lunch, which is cheap in my book.",3

We took a tour that starts from a joint about three blocks from the Cemetery - the Voodoo Lounge, I think it's called. We made a reservation through our hotel concierge and paid for the tickets before the 10 o'clock tour. You could get a drink there if you wanted, but we chose to not as we were facing a two-hour walkabout. Ladies note that the unisex potty is adequate for #1, but best do any heavy-duty action before you come. The line gets long as tour time approaches.

There are many reviews, but I can say that it was excellent. We learned a lot of New Orleans history from Robert, our guide. I have had guides in many places and he was one of the best. I had been to St. Louis No. 1 in 1951 when I was in New Orleans with my grandfather. We had a car and driver to show us the city and I remember that his wife, who had recently died, was buried there. In those simpler days, you could just wander in, but now you have to go with a tour. Sadly, that's needed to protect this historical site from desecration.

Points to remember: comfortable shoes, plenty of walking in areas where it would be easy to trip and fall, no bathroom facilities that I saw. If you haven't been you should go.",4

I'm used to Wetzels Pretzels which I already thought was expensive at $3.49 +tax  a pretzel. However Wetzle's tastes amazing so I give it a pass. 

But this place takes the cake in terrible costing and tasting pretzels! I think I HAVE paid less for a pretzel at Disneyland! And probably have had dog food that was richer in taste. (Why am I eating dog food? None of your business! Maybe I just like to know what it tastes like so I can write accurate reviews about poor taste, ok?) 

Ok so I bought this pretzel anyway because I had a BOGO coupon, but it so wasn't worth it. Even if the pretzel had been $1 I wouldn't return! This pretzel was stale, stiff and overly chewy like a steak that was a crappy piece of meat to begin with and then got over-cooked. It tastes like they made it no sooner than yesterday and it was thin, yet not that crispy. 

Absolutely hated this pretzel and I can't believe I was suckered into such a travesty by a stupid coupon from Tmobile! That's right Tmobile, I'm bringing you into this too- please don't ever pair up with this place again!",1

Both came with shoestring potatoes and everything was out-of-this-world delicious! The service was friendly and genuine. Our waiter was helpful and spot on with his suggestions. The surprise of the meal was the fantastic cup of coffee. Beans are ground as each portion is made with a french press, and the taste is amazing - rich without being bitter and a super smooth finish. I asked the waiter about it and learned that they serve something called Santa Lucia Estate coffee from a Nicaraguan company that is partly owned by the family of one of Luke's owners. Couldn't wait to get on-line and order some of the Vienna Roast for use at home and gift giving this holiday season.

Not attractive. 
My wife  ordered the brisket for lunch with mac and cheese and steamed veggies. I ordered the breakfast burger. My wife's entree came with more bbq sauce on the plate than meat. There were 4 skimpy pieces of brisket. It was hard to determine if the brisket was good because of the amount bbq sauce the.meat was swimming in. The bbq sauce tasted as if it was off the shelf KC's Masterpiece or Kraft.  It should have come on the side so the patron could decide how much or little was appropriate for their taste. The mac and cheese was bland and lacked the taste of cheese. Bad bad bad. 
The burger I ordered was supposed to be done medium. Instead I got a lump of meat charcoal on a roll. The Sous or chef should be  ashamed of themselves for presenting this in the window for service. This is cooking 101.

The service was painfully slow. I could understand if the place was jumping, but my wife and I were the only food patrons.

Avoid this place. The closing of this place cannot come soon enough.",1
1654,I have been to this location once before with no issues. Last time I got my soon a bubble tea. The pearls (tapicoa bubbles) seemed to make him sick. I hope this place does a better job at assuring the drinks/food is fresh.,1
1655,"I love Ruth Chris. We had a fantastic dinner followed by an even better dessert. The service was impeccable as well as the atmosphere. The reason this isn't a 5 star review is honestly all due to the valet service. I don't remember what valet was here before when we dined, but the new company, is not nearly as good. The guy was on his phone while i tried to get his attention, then my car smelled like cigarettes. Other than that, I loved my evening but I would not suggest the valet whatsoever.",3
1656,Service is rarely that great.  Food hits the spot.  They also have a few vegan meals on the menu which are delicious!!!,4
1657,"Unexpectedly the best part of our NOLA girls trip. To say I'm obsessed with this place and it's concept is an understatement. 

It's just as cool, casual and fun as everyone makes it sound - but the moment you roll up outside in your Uber, you'll probably think otherwise. And your friends will say ""Where the hell did you bring us."" It's way off the beaten path, hidden in a part of town that seems a bit industrial. Then, you walk in to a dark and dingy wine room, but don't let it fool you. 

You grab all of your supplies inside - bottle of wine etc.. Then, you step outside, grab a plastic bucket and fill it with water from the spout that's attached to the house (the establishment was transformed from a home). Then, you sit down in hodge-podge chairs and tables in the most charmingly lit and blossomed backyard. All while listening to a solo acoustic artist play guitar and sing sweet jams. NOW THE BEST PART. Go back inside, pick out a few blocks of local cheese, and they'll plate it for you (bread, jams, olives, cornichons) for a small fee. DO THIS. Some of the best cheese I've ever had, and they do a great job plating. 

We went on a Monday afternoon, and the backyard was pretty full for a weekday. The yard has the perfect amount of shade and sun, and we stayed much longer than we expected. Great HH deals, too. Pure bliss and the best break after a night spent on Bourbon St. Don't miss this spot.",5
1658,The food here is ok.  Nothing special. I think I like Dairy Queen hot dogs better but a fun place to take someone to that wants just a simple meal with some neat nostalgia.,3
1659,Very Rude door boys they are prejudiced and judgments. We all have money to spend and work hard all week and just want to come out and relax and have a good time but not at this place. They even called the cops on this party bus group that showed up because one guys clean cut didn't have his shirt tucked in. So the bouncer boy said tuck it in so he did then they said no you can't come in. WTF forget this place.,1
1660,"Well at least Jones is pretty consistent. But then again, you'd expect that out of a Steven Starr establishment.

Came back, brought my parents, and enjoyed another evening of comfort foods.

This time I was smart and ordered their Mac & Cheese to share with everyone. Honestly, I wasn't too impressed. It tasted just like Velveeta to me, same sharp cheese and thick consistency. I don't really mind Velveeta, I just was expecting something more...

My grilled cheese and tomato soup were very satisfying and my step-father practically licked his thanksgiving dinner plate clean. So all in all it was a successful trip. I just don't see the hype in their Mac & Cheese, o well...",3
1661,"Having just read about Marc Vetri and his eponymous restaurant in Bon Appetit (Sept issue), and having a scheduled trip to Philly, we decided to visit this much lauded Italian restaurant. You might have missed this place walking by it. The restaurant has only 35 seats, a very cozy atmosphere as you would find in typical Italian restaurants. Buon Ricordo (good memory) ceramic plates on the wall remind you that this chef travels to Italy often to further immerse himself in food.

The menu is updated weekly and changes with the season. They also offer 6 and 8 course tasting menus during the summer. We called just a day before our visit (they book 2 months ahead) we were very lucky to get in! The chef and staff were so welcoming and treated us like royalty! Here's what we ate:

Antipasti - huge antipasto round with lots of yummy grilled, marinated vegetables, smoky cheeses, mixed greens with grana, and freshly sliced ethereal slices of prosciutto done a la minute and brought to our table. We also ordered the Crisp Suckling Pig with Roasted Corn antipasto that was so delicious! The chef also sent out the Foie Gras Pastrami with Cherry Mostarda (the foie gras is ""cured"" like pastrami - this was such an amazing dish!).

For pastas, we ordered the Mint Pappardelle with Lamb and Sweet Pea Ragu and the signature Spinach Gnocchi with Shaved Ricotta and Brown Butter. Lots of butter in the gnocchi sauce! The gnocchi were almost entirely made of spinach - and just so light and delicate. The chef also sent out a taste of the not-on-the-menu corn ravioli with shaved black summer truffles from italy. Divine!

We decided to share the main course  - another signature: Roasted Capretto (baby goat) with Soft Polenta - it was out of this world! Chef Marc Vetri presented each dish to us, and this was especially incredible - they roast the goat outdoors for hours. It was so tender! 

Such a great experience and we loved meeting Marc. He is an incredible chef and we will be back!",5
1662,"G i'm only getting two stars because I've been there in the past and the food has been good. I ordered do you pick to roast a turkey and cranberry flatbread with the autumn harvest squash soup... I don't know what happened to their thinly sliced roasted chicken breasts that were in all of their dishes?  This flatbread was full of inedible goop (I saw one cranberry) and the rest was white??  And the chicken was chunked with some very chewy - gross - pieces...and I would be lying if I said there were more than 4 pitiful ""chunks"" of chicken in it.  Soup tasted ok, but more of a purée than a bisque.  I won't be ordering any of that again.  At least not at this store.  I would give this meal 1 star...ick.",2
1663,"This is one of my favorite places in Reno to eat or drink one of their microbrews.  The service and food is always consistent and their brews are the best!  The menu has a good variety of food and it's all delicous.  I wish there was one in Las Vegas, I miss this place!",5
1664,"Delicious food.  The place is located outside of Nashville and the interior has a lot of rustic charm.  Their bbq ribs were moist and flavorful, mac n cheese was creamy, and their tacos were simple but delicious.  We also ordered the wings without the sauce and they were fried and seasoned perfectly.  Wished we lived nearby, would come here regularly for sure.",4
1665,"This place is getting better each time we're here. We had twice came here with 20+ people dinner/party. Not only the food is good but the service by Victoria make your time here better and better. Some of our friends even have to add their parking meter because of the hospitality and the food. Food is good, portion is decent. Services are awesome. And even if it seems the place is small, we had 20+ people enjoying having dinner here.",4
1666,"I can't get enough of the Ziggy Burger, especially now that there is a University City location which means I can pick up an order after work and not have to worry about parking my car in the Rittenhouse neighborhood. If they add delivery - I'll be over the moon as it will mean a better take-out option when at work than Greek Lady. 

I heartily recommend the Ziggy Burger as the tempeh bacon and special sauce just really take the humble veggie burger to a whole new level of delicious. It will also keep you satisfied for hours. Splurge on some sweet potato fries as well for their slaty, tender goodness. I like the black bean cilantro dipping sauce which is a flavorful alternative to ketchup. 

If you're in the mood for something lighter, you can't go wrong with a green smoothie (groothie) or a banana whip. 

The service is ridiculously friendly and the orders are up quickly. I am always promptly greeted and the staff often provide great recommendations regarding menu items if you can't decide. If you're in a hurry, call ahead and your order is sure to be ready when you arrive. 

Compared to the Rittenhouse location this space is huge with seating for everyone! They still compost and recycle so after you satisfy your hunger you can satisfy your conscience as well.

I enjoy this place so much that I feel they should have a frequent buyer punch card for their burgers.",5
1667,"Of course we are from out of town. Drove by it alot so we stopped and tryed it, the food was great the atmosphere was great.. We had the rudest waitress i have ever encounter she did not say hi she never smiled it was like we were bothering her to be there.... i wish we would of had another waitress we probably would have stayed longer, i suggested to the people i was with after we paid our tab to her to go to the bar and they said no lets just get outta here...its amazing how one person can make you feel this way..",2
1668,"This is such a great neighborhood spot to listen to wonderful live music, great adult atmosphere, good food and drinks! This will be one of my favorite hangout spots on the weekends!!",5
1669,"The parking lot and the people surrounding it is a little scary.

The store is limited in my opinion. Definitely has its pros and cons. I found out there is an app u can download to load digital coupons by that seems like it's all the perks they have.

I was impressed that my nagger asked if I would like to have him load my bags in my car. Haven't had someone ask me that in a grocery store ever!

They have the BEST fried chicken but when I got home I didn't think mine was very fresh like I'm  used to. Granted it was almost closing time they should have had it discounted in my opinion.",3
1670,"Great dessert spot!  Very cool location and design, excellent desserts.  Parking is street only and can be a little crowded.  I don't believe they take reservations and I've had to wait every time I go.  I've never a meal there, but I assume it's great. Definitely worth going to and the waits aren't that bad.",4
1671,"Over priced for one.  And the lady there is full of crap.  I asked where i could get Khaffir Lime leaves, since she didn't have them.  She told me that I wouldn't be able to get Fresh Lime Leaves since they don't allow them in the country! (Say what?!) She directed me to two Asian spice Markets in university city that never even heard of them.  I found fresh lime leaves at a Thai Market in the Reading Terminal Market.  FRESH.   She is just full of crap.  And her prices for her spices are over priced.  It is catty corner from Di Bruno's.",1
1672,"We wanted to pick up some Zima and a male employee was very nice and said they were sold out and Zima is sold out everywhere in town. So he helped us pick out something he said will be similar but turns out grocery stores and Walmart have Zima. Lies. Oh, and P.S. Mr. Man, Truly Lime and Midori tastes nothing like Zima and Midori so thanks for that too.",1
1673,"I was surprised.  I was expecting a sit down individual table experience and got something a little better.  We walked in and were quickly asked ""Sushi or Hibachi?"".  The place is physically set up to serve Sushi on one side and the Hibachi tables are on the other side.  We said Hibachi which I thought meant individual tables and a back room kitchen made meal.  I was pleasantly surprised to be shown to one of those U shaped tables with the hot grill in the middle, a la Arigato's, Kobe's and a host of other Japanese Teppanyaki style cooking.  Ahhh, this is going to be good. We were a little earlier than the lunch crowd and it looked like the sushi side of the house was doing well.  Our side had 3 hibachi tables fully seated and the chef's doing their thing...ie egg into the hat, onion choo choo, etc.  
I chose Beef and Chicken and asked for only vegetables, no rice.  After all the fancy cooking, the metal spatulas and knives flying around, I got Beef and Chicken, vegetables and rice.  Later on, the manager and head Hibachi supervisor apologized time and time again.  No big deal.  I brought most of the rice home anyway for our granddaughter.  However, I noted one thing.  Don't be at the wrong end of the table.  It seemed the other folks to my right got decent portions of each item, I ended up with what was left, which appeared slightly less on the beef, chicken and vegetables.  Also, I asked for medium cooked on the beef, others asked for well done.  The beef went on and came off the grill at the same time, so how was mine any different from their's. 

All in all, an okay experience.  Will I go back....maybe.",3
1674,"First things first...This hotel is very big, pretty, and clean. The hotel staff are all really friendly and helpful. It's like a Vegas Style resort(One of the reasons why Nashville is refereed to as Nashvegas?). There are tons of restaurant options, fun little bars, and maps all over the place. I didn't get lost once. With that said..... 

My advice to someone coming to Nashville for the first time is... Don't stay here. Here are my reasons why: 

-It's far from town. About 10 miles. And let's be real...that's probably why you come to Nashville?

-Unless you have a rental car, you will be in Taxi or shuttle debt. One way to downtown in Taxi is $25 or the Gaylord shuttle is $30 something for Roundtrip...but the last pickup was a little too early for my liking. 

-The city bus doesn't come very often and doesn't run late. But a way cheaper way to get into town. ($1.60) 

-The restaurants are expensive and they don't have any local appeal. When I'm traveling, I want to eat local fare. Why isn't there southern food, bbq? 

-I feel like they basically want you to stay on their property the entire time! 

-Expensive! I didn't have to pay for my room (thank god) but if I had to I couldn't afford to. 

All in all, I had a great time in Nashville...but having stayed here I spent way more money on transportation then I thought I would. 
This place is definitely worth checking out but I would skip staying here.",3
1675,"One of the few diners in North Wilmington, and the only one that probably isn't really bad. I've had totally ordinary diner fare here, and used to come by after swim meets. Nothing particularly good or bad about this place.",3
1676,"Usually I wait at least 2 weeks to write a hair review however I can tell that a great job was done already. I have a background in cosmetology so I already know how to do hair, but for lazy purposes I like to go to a salon for my own head. I came on a walk in day and was in and out which I liked. The salon was clean and the staff was pretty friendly. A stylist named Erica did my sew in and girl named Chante did my braids. Both lady's did a great job. I really liked that Erica did not leave too much space in between my tracks which some salons tend to do. She also paid a lot of attention to my leave out. Instead of giving my leave out a basic flat iron on top, she took her time and blended it right. You can tell she cares about her work. Will recommend to my friends and will most likely revisit. 4 stars since they charge $20 more for each bundle added after 2. Don't get me wrong I'm not cheap but 3 bundles is equivalent to 2 packs of beauty supply hair if you think about it so thats one charge I didn't quite understand. Nonetheless still a decent sew in for under a $100. 


Now for an updated review: If you don't care about being in an unfriendly and unprofessional environment, this would be the perfect salon for you. Yes, it is a cheap & affordable alternative than going to other high end salons in the area BUT this place is not what it used to be. I loved this salon before but I'm not sure if the management changed or the stylists just stopped giving a rats ass. For one, when you walk in the salon YOU DON'T feel the least bit welcomed. The receptionist is beyond ratchet. Like BEYOND! From gossiping to outright falling asleep at the desk. Yes, falling asleep! For two, none of the good stylists with the exception of one named Carl even works here anymore. I wish that I could post pictures of how bad my hair came out but since I started taking it out as soon as I hopped in my car I can't. $100.00 down the drain. The stylist who did my hair was named Brandy. Brandy took THREE HOURS to do a sew in. A bad one at that. My braids were loose and bumpy. The tracks were spread so far apart! She had a nice attitude but the poor baby just didn't know what she was doing. She said that she went to beauty school but the only thing she did good was cut my bang. The rest looked absolutely horrible. She told me she had only been there for two weeks and that should have been que to get up. If you need a cheap sew in go here, but if you have the money do yourself a favor and go somewhere that's gonna do quality work.",1
1677,"Place is similar to Applebee's ... the food is alright and my stomach was bugging me for a while. I came back here for the second time to see if I'd feel the same and I was unfortunately let down with the food. For the price, I expect some better quality.",2
1678,"I suppose it was good for the price, but I just felt so unhappy with both the color and the cut that I would've rather saved up a bit longer for a better hair cut. The highlights weren't evenly blended with the rest of my hair and the cut was uneven.",2
1679,"Not bad. Average Thai. Not very spicy despite getting level 3. Below average service. Place is also pretty tiny. Better Thai places available for sure. Can't recommend, but not terrible.",3
1680,"I got very sick and unfortunately gave my cat a few bites of my chicken and it ended up costing me $300 in vet bills and my cat almost died.

The manager responded and tried to blame us for this issue.
Very professional Glen G. 
I assume he is uneducated and lacking in any skills.",1
1681,"Two and s half stars !  Not a fan of most chains as they are nothing more than controlled mediocrity !  This location is the same ... 

Service is painfully slow, orders are not accurate, and anything sent back again is a wait and wonder if it will ever come out or if everyone will be finished be the time it's finally replaced .

My recommendation is drive 5 miles down the road and get your pizza from Wegmans!!",3
1682,"Jones is definitely average quality, not many complaints, but nothing to really rave over either. We went as a group of five with a reservation so we didn't have to wait long for a table. They have a limited menu during certain times, so be careful of that. It was very busy and loud, but this wasn't an issue for us. We would go back if there weren't any other options, but considering the area, there are many other better options.",3
1683,"The food was very food, but the service was paaaainfully slow. We sat there for what must've been 20 minutes before ordering our drinks. The drinks were delivered by someone other than our server. We didn't place our dinner order until I was almost done with my glass of wine. Food came out promptly and was delivered by someone other than our server. This was at 6:30 on a Tuesday and not during Mardi Gras or anything like that. 

My husband and I both had filet mignon with spinach and potatoes. The spinach was surprisingly delicious. Potatoes could've used a little something. Steaks were cooked perfectly. You could cut it with a butter knife. So yum. 

Good experience overall, but I'm glad I wasn't super hungry when we got there!",3
1684,"Brianna provides the best service to me every night I see her. Kaela is one of the greatest, always look forward to seeing her. I keep coming back just because of them. NOBODY ELSE. Except for Jenna Boyd. I love jenna.",5
1685,This place has decent Chinese food at reasonable to cheap prices.  The location has been multiple places and was most recently a vegetarian Indian establishment.  You can easily drive past this restaurant and not even notice it.  There has only been one person working the front of house during all my visits and it hasn't ever been crowded during lunch so this has been a quick lunch spot.  It's a pretty bare bones and basic place without a lot of atmosphere but that seems to be reflected in their affordable prices.,3
1686,"We came here because of the pics and the reviews, but the food was ok. She had the muffuletta and I had crab cakes and gumbo. The service was really good, Tatiana kept us happy and did her best. The drinks were touristy and just ok. If you want to spend the money, stop by, otherwise take yourself elsewhere for the price.",3
1687,"This place is truly average. I've been here on 3 different occasions and have found the menu to stay almost completely the same, with very limited options. 

I've tried the steak, the burger, and the soft shell crab BLT. Out of those 3, the burger was the best, because a burger can never be that terrible. The steak as I recall was just decent and lacked much taste. Last night I tried the soft shell crab blt. It was definitely a beautiful presentation, but there was way too much going on in regards to taste. It was sweet and salty, which tasted weird. There was some sort of bbq sauce on it that completely ruined the dish in my opinion. It was also overpowered by lettuce. The French fries here are completely mediocre too. 

I also ordered one of their special drinks. The drink was extremely strong and difficult to even put down. 

So, why 3 stars? Service was damn good. And their raw bar is unbelievable. Some of the best oysters I've had.",3
1688,"Don't go on Sundays. I want to like this place but they won't let me. Tonight was the third time after two ""eh"" trips. The food is good. The presentation is very bad. The taste of the house margaritas is a selling point, however, you get 4 oz of ice and probably 3 oz of actual margarita if you're lucky. The service is not good. There is no accountability from management or servers. I was told ""It's not my fault, guys."" tonight (8/24/14) that I had to wait over an hour for food. I never received my refried beans and rice so that made it sting a little more to be overpaying for a mediocre experience.    

I wanted this place to open and be awesome but it seems like all they did was open. More classic dishes need to be added, prices need to be evaluated and customer service and staffing needs some serious attention. I may give it a shot after some time has passed when the kinks may be worked out. I have no intention of going back until I hear something different.  Even then it's going to be hard to drag me in there. Again, this is a bummer because I want to like this place and give them my money AND feel good about it.",1
1689,"I live within a stones throw of this place, and let me tell you that the burgers are not good, dry at best and are never cooked as you want them to be. 

Their milkshakes are alright, could be better; could be worse. Right across the street is a wawa, and they have milkshakes there too which are just as good, if not better. 

Their fries are pretty good with their sauce (its some horseradish ketchupy something or another).

Unless you just want fries; I wouldn't bother. 

Used to get a lot of hype, no one goes there no and for quite good reason!",2

1692,"The food was good, but that was the only thing that was. Long lines, sullen service. One of the counter people just seemed to wander off. One funny thing---the counter person made a big deal of using her safe serve wrappers to grab a bagel, just as the grumpy old guy who calls you for your order showed up with two completely unprotected fists full of bagels. Well, funny but also gross.",2
1693,"OPEN TIL 3 AM for those late night hunger crawls! BUT be willing to throw some bows because this small little fast food joint is PACKED in the wee hours of the night

---truffle fries: nice & crispy, the winner of the night!

you can choose your sauces for dipping the fries.. i liked the spicy fry sauce much more than the white ""house"" sauce.. i think those are the 2 most popular ones

1694,"I was really hoping that my 200th review would result in a stellar five-star experience. I even took myself out of my familiar neighborhood and into an area where I thought I had a better chance of snagging that five-star review. While I was tempted to try out the nearby Nickel Plate Bar & Grill, I opted for Brixx Wood Fired Pizza inside The Depot right off East 116th Street and right next to the Fishers city government complex. 

Parking is a wee bit tricky with construction going on within the city complex area, but there's an adjacent parking garage that offers spots for those visiting the retail area of The Depot. There's also one ADA disabled parking spot on the street. 

The restaurant itself is accessible with a workable door going in. I was attracted to Brixx by their sign offering a $7.95 luncheon special, though I arrived toward what the end of what would be considered lunch. I was dining alone and was escorted to a small end of the bar that had been clearly designed for wheelchairs. Giordano's has this same kind of counter. I wished I'd taken my seat cushion as the counter was just a touch higher than my wheelchair and required some stretch. They also offer outdoor dining that is wheelchair friendly. 

Brixx Wood Fired Pizza offers, of course, wood-fired pizzas - they are all 10"" pizzas and come in nearly 25 varieties including veggie and gluten free options. Vegan cheese is available at no charge, but there's a $3 upcharge for gluten-free crust. The prices range from $8.95 - $13.95. The lunch option either wasn't an option or simply wasn't offered - as I knew I was splurging on ice cream, I didn't want to totally blow my dietary regimen by eating an entire pizza. So, I looked at the sandwich menu that includes six sandwiches/wraps. They also offer starters, pasta, beer, wine, cocktails, salads, desserts, and a kids menu. I opted for a Roasted Chicken Club on toasted focaccia. While I'd thought it was $8.95, a review of the online menu does confirm it is the only sandwich not $8.95 - It's $9.95. You have the choice of chips, quinoa salad, bean salad, or fresh fruit as a side. I opted for chips. 

The entire bill came in at right around $13 with my unsweetened iced tea. 

The sandwich arrived and was about what you'd expect from a pizza/deli type sandwich. It was good, but it was quickly becoming clear that a 5-star review was not in the cards. The sandwich was tasty, but a bit light on the ingredients. However, they mixed together well. It was good and I would eat it again, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to get it. The chips were a nice accompaniment, sort of in the Broad Ripple Chip Company ballpark (but not as good). If I could give a .5 star, the food would easily be in the 3.5 range. 

The service? It's always a risk to arrive at the tail end of what was considered ""lunch."" It looked like there was one manager present who was doing some training and a handful of servers and other crew handling the remaining tables, doing miscellaneous errands, and doing a wee bit too much standing around in my estimation - I say this because in my placement at the end of the bar, I had at least a couple occasions where 2-3 servers would be gathered within a couple feet talking. It was distracting to both my meal and to the magazine I was reading. 

The servers and staff were friendly, though I found service itself a bit off pace. The female who initially seated me took the iced tea order and got me set up, but it took several minutes for my server to arrive at the table. I acknowledged having difficulty deciding on options for a single diner (hoping that would trigger either the lunch special suggestion or another idea). Instead, Jeremy sort of agreed that the servings are kind of large for one person. (Suggestions, maybe?). At that point, I very nearly paid for my iced tea and left. 

I eventually decided on the meal ordered. Jeremy was more attentive and was friendly throughout, though he seemed to have other responsibilities that kept him distracted. I did receive my always desired refills, so that was a plus. Overall, I'd put the service in the 3-star range. It was a touch slow, definitely distracted, and didn't make me want to go back. I was disappointed by the lack of suggestions, a bit uncomfortable in the space where I'd been seated, and generally felt like an afterthought during the late lunch hours. However, staff were friendly and I never felt unwelcome. I also thought a couple of the servers who weren't mine actually paid more attention and were conversational. So, that helped. 

Brixx was practically the definitive 3-star experience, slightly above average - I can picture them having days where they hit that 4, but just watching them I can also understand some of the 2-star reviews given here. It certainly won't be a destination spot for me, but if I have friends who want to try it out I won't be opposed and would love to try the pizza.",3
1695,"The store and employees are fine. In fact, a couple of the employees are VERY fine...as in ""sexy as hell."" But all these complaints about the pharmacy are 100% accurate. They never act with any sense of urgency, even though the line of customers is usually at least 5 deep, and they display almost zero empathy. When you call, you're always on hold for at least a couple minutes before you end up talking to someone who sounds too bored to be bothered. 

My doctor said they sent a prescription to CVS a few days ago. I still hadn't received the call from CVS telling me that it's ready. I just called and a girl (who sounded too tired to fully form words) managed to tell me that she sees it in the system. She said they can fill it today if I'd like to pick it up. I said, ""Well, yeah."" Her response: ""It'll be about an hour to ninety minutes."" 

#1. WHY WOULD IT TAKE 90 MINUTES TO PUT PILLS IN A BOTTLE?! 
#2. WHY DID THEY NOT FILL THE RX WHEN IT ORIGINALLY CAME IN FROM MY DOCTOR?!

The answer to both questions is ""incompetence.""",2

1697,"Went with great expectations based on the word of a friend. Ten dollar cab ride there and back from our hotel down town. Gotta say it was  disappointing.  The ""Woodstock"" burger was tasty enough, but for eleven dollars they should have given me two of them. Bun was mushy super market variety and burger was not cooked as ordered (medium rare) I should have known it wouldn't be since the server didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked- I had to tell him after he took the order. I suspect they cook all the burgers the same. 
Fries were just plain crappy, limp and burnt. Do not make a special trip 'cause it aint special.",2
1698,"Really? $45.00 to ""hold my rate?"" The trick fees and surprise billing that shows up in my checking account every few months is garbage. The monthly fee doesn't sound so bad, but the surprise fees and the $100.00 fee to cancel the account is somewhat discouraging as well. 

You can work out here if you're rich and have money to blow, but being a member here has severe financial disadvantages.",1
1699,"Went all in on a triple after walking around for a few hours on a relatively crisp evening, and didn't regret it at all. Wasn't overly impressed, but certainly solid product.",4
1700,"I've been here multiple times and always love their convenient location and decent drinks (they can make a good Irish Car Bomb). We came here often to throw get togethers or just to meet people prior to going to the movies. The food isn't bad at all and it's rather convenient getting drunk and playing a bunch of games to break up whatever dullness you're having with the crowd you're with. So after starting this review I realize I have very little to write. So I'm going to assume that this review will be meant to inform anyone that they can expect a goods drink and a decent atmosphere. A huge bonus is the fire pit outside to keep you warm during the ""cold"" Tucson nights.",3
1701,"Worst BYOB I've been to ! Came in with a group and as we we're waiting for guests to arrive we asked for bread and were told we can't have bread until we order appetizers. The server never asked us if we wanted appetizers at the time. The server also told my friend to move into table closer two times, very rudely . The tables are like 3 inches apart to begin with! Food was not authentic! Lacked serious flavor! Blah! This is why I cook at home. Tiny cash only BYOB should be more welcoming",1
1702,"Ligne Roset is a very old, 1860,  furniture making company with headquarters and factories in France.  The store in Manayunk is one of 200 worldwide.  Their furniture is ultra clean modern in design and of the highest quality.  You will hear fans of Ligne Roset telling you that their prices are great.  Gauged against design and craftsmanship this is true, but it is anything but cheap.  If you are a fan of Italian, modern French and Scandinavian design, scanning their web site, and store, is a must.  And they have a child's line, Les Minis, if you want to spoil the kid from the jump.",5
1703,"William Penn would give R2L five thumbs up

Greeted with sparkling wine and a warm smile, I found solace from the city's cold winter night in the hospitality received at my entrance. The manager greeted me with a smile and escorted myself to the private quarters where I would wait for my fellow companions to join me for an evening gallivant over rich foods, and fine drink.  The view 30 stories up was majestic, and gave one the spirit of a dignified patron who took pleasure in the finer things in life. The staff were as sumptuous as the meal and the flavors of five courses sang a symphony atop my pallet. 

Thanks again for the excellent experience, I cant wait to have my next party here. 

Fellow Yelpers, if you have a need for fine libations, an excellent venue and a five star staff, take my word and seek no further. You may thank me later",5
1704,"Ugh, what a disappointment. My husband and I love creole, Cajun cooking and had such high hopes for this place. We had heard great things. The appetizers were great, the bloody Mary's good and the service was fantastic. So why only two stars? The entrees were not good. I had crab ravioli and it was ok. Decent sauce but not real pizazz. My husband had the jambalaya and cat fish and to be honest it seemed as if it was left overs. The jambalaya was horrible-old. The shrimp and sausage were falling apart as of cooked way too long and there was just no flavor. Very disappointing.",2
1705,Earwig (bug) crawling around on the seared tuna salad. We started with the boudin balls & crab claws which were great. But my entree had a live bug crawling around on it. Allegedly everyone else at the table enjoyed their food but it insect definitely spoiled the mood to say the least. The waitress was apologetic but we were billed for the entirety of our meal. Maybe a fluke but it was poorly handled. Inspect your food before you dive in.,2
1706,"I've been to Trattoria Carina twice now, once when it was first trying out a small menu, and again now that it uses its full menu. Both times the food was excellent. The first time I was there, I sat outside and enjoyed a nice evening and long conversation with a friend. Tonight, however, I sat inside with a friend and after having been there for 1 hour and 15 minutes and ordering two appetizers and two entrees we were promptly asked by our server to leave to free up the table. I thought this was quite rude. The restaurant does not take reservations because it wants to have a relaxed neighborhood feel, but it does not feel very neighborly or relaxed to kick your customer out after an hour and fifteen minutes. Perhaps it would be better to take reservations and not rush their guests.",4
1707,"Cover charge for shows during dinner service seems unnecessary.

I enjoy Puckett's, and their food is consistently good for the price. Basically a classy pick three with ok service and decent drinks. Most recently came on Friday night and would have much preferred to spend the $48 dollars we were charged for cover on tips for the band. It is a favorite with the locals and will get packed on the weekends so make reservations early.",3
1708,"Food was good.  Waitress was attentive - probably too attentive.  She brought us the wrong check - of course, ours was higher!  Figures!  The main peeve was the opera singer - from his bad toupee to the volume, it was almost comical.  When he did ""Sweet Caroline"" in an operatic style, all we could do was laugh!",2
1709,"3.5 stars. Everyone gave this place rave reviews so I had to give it a try. Remember to bring cash because no credit cards accepted! I had the chili cheese etouffee with crawfish. It came out fast, I though it was tasty, really cheesy and heavy, with really soft garlic bread. I'm usually not a big fan of heavy food but this place was pretty good. I would have to come back and try the other items again.",3
1710,The food is very good. The service is a little lacking. The atmosphere is definitely very homey as it is in an old house. I was not very happy paying $4.00 for three small glasses of ice tea. It is absurd to have to pay for refills on fountain drinks. I am sure they charge for seconds of rice as they only brought me about a cup of white rice with my entree. I feel that I should be told there there is going to be additional charges that are not specified on the menu.,2
1711,"Service is ok, cooler and dining on your beignets inside isnt the same but on a hot and humid night you can appreciate the blasting A/C in Morning Call.

Cash, parking lot, little wait time.

Prices have gone up but who is gonna complain when it's still pretty cheap. Beignets here are lighter and come plain so that you can toss your own confectioner sugar on it.

Overall if you want the tourist experience head down the French Quarter's, and put your elbows on the sticky tables down there.",2
1712,"A nice spot for BBQ. Busy, but plenty of open tables. Food came out under 10 minutes. Giving four stars because the server rolled his eyes when we asked him a question. Besides that, a good experience.",4
1713,"I love the taste of Baskin Robins ice cream, but I cannot get over the rude staff at this location. If you're in a bad mood & need ice cream to cheer you up, DO NOT GO HERE. The employees' rudeness will make your mood even worse. Your money will buy you ice cream here. Definitely not customer service.",2
1714,"This is the first restaurant review I have ever written but, this place was such a disappointment that I would like to save someone else from wasting their money and time on Ho Ho's like we did. First, I will start off with the positive. The Crab Rangoon was good and they were large. Sadly, that is the only nice thing I have to say. We ordered our food and the person I was with ordered extra pork with his fried rice and asked how much the extra pork cost and how much pork would he get. The young lady's response was, ""not very much"". He made a circle with his hand and asked if that was how much or more and she looked horrified and continued to say, ""not very much"". He went ahead and ordered it with an extra cost of $2.00 which is (2) extra portions of pork. There were 3 dirty bikes and 2 filthy high chairs in the VERY dated dining room. We pulled our chairs out and they were so dirty our hands were sticking to the chairs. We noticed the packets of sugar were from Ameristar and the sugar free packets were from another restaurant. Our drinks came in cracked plastic cups that still had the price tag sticker on the bottoms of them and the ice was out of a regular freezer and you could taste that it was old ice. It took forever to get our food. He ordered a Pork St. Paul Sandwich which came on the tiniest slices of bread with very old, dry pork. Until then, I thought all bread slices were the same size. I ordered Chicken Lo Mein and the chicken was horrible! It didn't even taste like chicken.The lo mein was spaghetti and there was so much soy sauce that it was soup. I asked for red sweet and sour sauce and the girl brought it out in and old honey container and the container was very sticky. Not from the sweet and sour spilling on it but, it was as if it had been sitting on a shelf by a fryer. There were big chunks of something in it. Finally, the person I was with got their fried rice to go that was supposed to have 2 extra servings of pork yet, it still fit into the usual small container and there was no extra pork. At that point, we just wanted out of there. I have been disappointed in restaurants but, this place made me angry. It was a COMPLETE waste of money and they obviously take no pride in the making of their food. The quality of the food or experience very clearly means nothing to the owners of this restaurant. If you see it-KEEP DRIVING!!!!!!",1
1715,"Went here last Sunday for happy hour with some friends. They offer a selection of small appetizers for a good deal ranging from $1 pita and hummus to $4 for mussels (2 per order). I ordered the white peach sangria for $4 and thought it was delicious! The only down side was our server who was a bit slow with bringing out our order. It also took more than 15 min to get an extra side of pita bread. 

I love the eclectic and artsy atmosphere and will certainly be back.",3
1716,"I met Amin (Bitar's owner). I returned the molded pita bread last week and got refunded for it. He apologize and I did appreciate that, since I always buy my pita bread from Bitar's! 
 I'm so happy that he could also help me do a bakesale at his store so that I can raise money for the Arthritis Foundation. I  and my team ""CHEF CHERRYL"" will be walking a 5k on Dec 4, 2011 in Metuchen, New Jersey.

1717,It's been a while since we ate here and I must say that it will be even longer before we go back. Food is OK at best. Veggies were steamed & mushy. Chipotle chicken was only OK & very spicy. Probably too hot for most people. Service was good.,2
1718,"Totally decent joint for a quick, fresh breakfast.  My wife, the ultimate breakfast snob, declared that her omelette was ""way better than Mother's."". Wasn't crazy about the blaring hip hop over the speakers but food was solid and they are open on Thanksgiving.",3
1719,Tasty food. Slightly marked up with prices but that's to be expected since it is on Stearn's Wharf. LONG WAIT!!,3
1720,"Went in for dinner, sat at the bar, good service. 

I had high expectations for the food based on reviews here. We started with the bacon grease popcorn - I really didn't think it was anything special, and I could still kind of taste it the next day. We ate  half the bag. We then had fried oysters, fried green tomatoes, and the Boudin Balls. Of these the only one i would order again is the oysters. The other items were kind of meh. Dinner for me was brisket with mac n cheese and beans on the side. The Brisket was good. I'm not going to call it great, I've had much better, but it was good. The mac n cheese and beans fall into the same category. Huge sides. I ate maybe 1/4 of them, maybe. My cohort had the pulled pork sandwich and declared it excellent. Am I glad to check this off the list? Yes. Do I wish I'd gone to Amada or Buddokan for dinner after drinks at Khbyer Pass Pub, you bet I do. 

great place for drinks - really, but i think i'll leave it at that. Maybe the oyster app.",3
1721,"Bunch of high school/college kids running the place. The food is decent, but just decent. 50% chance they will mess up your order in some capacity...",2
1722,"It was a decent place. I mean, I will go again. 

I had no idea that they were going to be showing the UFC fight so it was very crowded. Parking was a nightmare so I suggest getting there early or carpooling. 

The staff was nice and the bartender was quick. There was a lot of people watching and I felt crazy old since I'm pretty sure everyone there was freshly 21. 

Didn't get any food but the table across from me got wings and I could smell them from a mile away. They gobbled them up pretty quick so they must have been good.",3
1723,"Oh, SATCO.  You're not the best taco shop but you do have your moments.

I come to SATCO for:

1.  An inexpensive lunch.
2.  Queso
3.  Outside seating with music loud enough to drown out thoughts of my To Do List.
4.  Great for groups.
5.  Cheap beer.

What I don't come to SATCO for:

1.  Authentic Mexican food.
2.  A quiet lunch.
3.  A Vandy student-free lunch.
4.  Their guacamole dip.

Yep, that about sums it up!",2

1725,I came here with my Peruvian girlfriend. I have been to a Peruvian restaurant in New York with her. and it was delicious. So I figured I'd give it a shot again .I ordered the half chicken cilantro meal and my sides .it was very good very tasty and a lot of food. however I felt as if I was being somehow overlooked by the wait  staff .personally. I don't know its just that when you're looking at someone in the eyes and asking them to come over and they turn around and do something else its just like they are ignoring .so I don't know maybe it's just me. but the food is excellent,3
1726,Rons still a regular stop for me.  Usually some good craft beers  (excellent this week) and tasty food  (if you know what to stick with on menu).,4
1727,"My go-to for pizza in the montgomeryville/chalfont area! Always delicious, never disappoints.",5
1728,"I purchased a pair of the Willie Rigid jeans, to be shortened before being sent to me. When they arrived, they had the ""chalk mark"" from the tailor. I called to find out how to remove the chalk mark, which didnt work, then at their recommendation, went down the road of washing them (cold water) - which only shrunk the jeans, which are ""non-returnable"" because they were hemmed. I now have a $ 250 pair of un-wearable jeans in my closet. Never worn..........They need much better customer service  and communication to make it n the high priced Jean market.  

 I do like the material and styling, just wish I had a pair to actually wear after spending $ 250.00",1
1729,"I adore In-N OUt burgers - get them animal style or try them in a lettuce wrap (protein style).  They've got a special menu not listed (http://www.in-n-out.com) and their fries are amazing - you can actually taste the potato in them.  Their menu is very basic but it's all you need - burgers, fries, and shakes.",5
1730,Slow service but friendly staff. Customized veggie pasta for my husband. I liked my shrimps. My friends took gumbo and oysters nd were not big fans. But the angel hair pasta with shrimp was pretty good. the best part was the bread pudding. Overall decent place. Not a place I would go again though.,3
1731,I had a scheduled appointment no one came to greet me as I pulled up which was fine as I was. 15 minutes early.  I waited a total of 50 minutes still not one service representative met with me.  I had made this appointment a week and half prior.  A service tech came by and asked that I move my car to make room for others this is waiting 1 hour 37 minutes to get waited on .  I said sure and just left as he had no idea when someone would meet with me.  The last thing I get is a voicemail saying I missed my appointment if I wanted to reschedule.  No wonder this dealership has so low ratings.  I will call Honda customer service and voice my concerns next week.,1
1732,I try to support local businesses. Encountered the most racist/rude cashier yesterday...totally supported/encouraged by management. Will never be back to get gas or anything there.,1
1733,What is not to love about ted drewes?   It was the first place my husband brought me on a pre marriage trip to Saint Louis.  We ended up going four times in one weekend.  The only thing that would make it better is if it was calorie free!,5
1734,"The food was actually excellent.  I had a filet that really was cooked perfectly.  The service was excellent as well although they could be more assertive in refilling water and coffee.   

For me, this place is terrific because they let our group sit even before everyone arrived.  You know how some restaurants have silly rules about the entire group being present?  They don't enforce this and while we were waiting at our table, the waitress was more than patient in serving us drinks while we waited for the rest of the group.  This is service!

Fun bar and a fun atmosphere.  It really is a cute place.  I'd go back.",4
1735,"This is my local convenience store.  The place is open 24/7
The ATMS are no surcharge (yes!!!)
They place really, really cool music!

(OK, so I just glanced over at Simon E.'s review of this same WaWa and he says the vibe is upbeat, and that is def. true!  Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)

Gripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  

Gripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.

Major points for:  
*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  
*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!
*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks/protein bars, drinks, etc.
*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!
*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.

I do not eat any of the hot food.  Low quality, I steer clear.  


For a convenience store that is open 24 hours, WaWa is awesome!  

Does this one have a bathroom?  I never used it, I never checked....but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there!  Maybe it is around back?  Hmmm.  I would avoid using it anyway.  
Also, this WaWa could never have gas pumps, traffic is already congested between Allens Lane and Mt. Airy Avenue along Germantown Ave.  (Between WaWa and the Bank of America on the corner.)
Overall:  This place is awesome based on the music selection and friendly staff working 24/7.  This store does a lot right!",4
1736,I would've given it no stars at all if this were an option. My wife ordered cheesecake and coffee. The cheesecake was ridiculously tiny and the coffee tasted like dirt. I ordered a chicken pesto sandwich which was simply about-to-go-bad chicken on stale bread. The only Ok thing about this restaurant was the veggies; they did look and taste fresh. But that's about it. I do not recommend at all.,1
1737,"Limoncello is one of our favorite restaurants in the Borough which has become a great little town over the years with lots of choices for food and drink.  We were there for our anniversary and had a great experiences as always.  This place is the perfect mix of local, variety of ages, casual, friendly and very excellent food.  This night I had the chef's salmon special.  OMG.  Seriously!  It was absolutely the most delicious salmon I have ever had.  Can't really say what the spices were but along with the crab topping it all worked to make my taste buds explode.  No, really they did.  The lady had a chees board to start things off and loved it very much.  Talks about it all the time.",5
1738,"Haslam's has size, and maybe that's about it. There's thousands of books, and if you look hard enough, you'll find a treasure. Overall, though, I'm always disappointed at the prices on the used books. They're USED. They should be $5 tops, not $15-20. I don't care how immaculately the previous person handled them. They're used or they're new, they're cheap or they're not.

That being said, the cat's a real cutie.",3
1739,"All I can really say is WoW.  The flavors were fantastic.  Quattro Formaggi, Crudo and Sea Salt and Rosemary.  The service was great.  The open pizza area was great to watch these guys at their work.  Beer list is awesome.  What else can I say.  Go.  Eat Pizza the way it should have always been.",5
1740,"Two stars and that is being generous! OVERPRICED AND ALWAYS CROWDED. Oh wait they do have a student discount, but it's only valid I think one or two nights a week! What's that all about? If you do make the mistake of coming, be prepared to spend close to $30 for two people and snacks.",2
1741,Horrible service.  Horribly managed.  Constantly out of something in the mornings.  Drive thru orders are often wrong.  Bad days can be expected anywhere but it's constant here.,1
1742,"I've been a regular customer here for the past 10 months. Today, I decided this to be my last visit to this place. The service staff and the cooking staff are not polite. They kept staring at me and my friends while eating. It worth mentioning that this is all you can eat restaurant; however, in order to make us feel full quickly, they decided to put a quantity of rice double the size of the sushi. When we left some rice, they decided to charge us for it. They were not polite by telling us you're ordering too much quantities and that's why we concluded that they put too much rice. The girls serving was talked to us in a rude way and one of them used her finger tips to point to us while talking. I will stop coming to this place again",1
1743,What can I say.... I paid 10$ to park then waited over 20 minutes for a server. Finally after flagging down two waitresses I got the managers attention and was informed it was shift change and a waitress would be over shortly. Needless to say I left. I can't imagine the service would get any better as the meal went on. The manager refused to refund my parking and offered nothing other than a pitiful explanation that it was shift change.,1
1744,"Yum. Tater tots on pizza. Late night delivery that came faster than promised. Friendly staff taking the order, and a delivery guy who made me smile. Can't ask for much more. Thanks! We wish we lived closer...",4
1745,"Making a bridal appointment to look at bridesmaid dresses was easy peasy, with less than 7 days notice I was able to name my time and date for a private appointment.  I sent our stylist my pinterest page full of Amsale, Jenny Yoo, and Monique Lhullier dresses.  On the phone I was asked for my bridesmaids' shoe & dress sizes.  I was also asked to describe what colors we were interested in, and what styles we definitely did not want to see.  

When we showed up for our appointment the bridal suite dressing room was full, so we were ushered to the regular fitting rooms.  No biggie, but it was awkward and cramped.  Turns out Nordstrom didn't have any Amsale dresses we requested, nor did they have the sizes we needed.  When my size 6 wearing friend asked for shoes she was given a pair of black pumps several sizes too big (maybe an 8 or 9).  It was also difficult to view the colorways each dress came in - the sales associate ended up bringing us her ipad to show us the options, but this sort of defeated the purpose of being in-store to see the dresses.

After trying about three dresses, it was very clear only one of them might work.  Unfortunately the Jenny Yoo dress we liked takes up to 4 months to order, and our orders would be final sale.  Also a bummer?  They didn't have any dresses or fabric swatches in the color we were interested in.  With so little flexibility we were left with no choice but to leave empty handed.

Honestly, the sales associate tried to be helpful, but my friends and I left wondering why we made the appointment in advance when they didn't have the styles, sizes, or colors we were interested in.",3
1746,"Got the banana split, chocolate glaze and mocha donut. Chocolate glaze was very rich and I don't like too rich so it wasn't for me but the banana split was delicious. Didn't really taste like a banana split, more like a cream puff flavored with a lil banana but I liked it. It's about $2 per donut",3
1747,"Stumbled across the Village Pub & Beer Garden on a busy Saturday night and decided the place looked hoppin' so why not give it a try? 

Walked into the busy bar and we were immediately greeted by a nice host who informed us that it was spot a seat, take a seat type seating. It brought a competitive edge to our dining experience. He also informed us that it was a smoking establishment outside on the patio. He was very nice explained to us some beers and offered to get us one while we waited for a table to open up. 

The ambiance was a little too college bar for me. Very crowded, loud, and smoke filled. We patiently waited for a table that we were stalking to open up and swooped in when we saw our chance. They were either under staffed or overwhelmed with the crowd because flagging down a server was a difficult task. Our server seemed too busy to explain to us anything on the menu or any beer we might want to try. That and it was almost too loud for me to hear my friend sitting just inches in front of me (this was on the patio)

When our food finally arrived it came out nice and hot. I had the bratwurst rueban and my partner in crime had the blackened chicken sandwich. All of their sandwiches come on pretzel bread (literally a pretzel cut in half as bread) which was a cool spin on a sandwich. They were both delicious and something different.  

Overall the Pub was fine, nothing special, and no place to take a date. Way too loud. If you are looking to get a few drinks and maybe it would be better not on a Saturday night it seems like a good place to grab a sandwich and beer.",3
1748,"We went on a Saturday and it was ""sold out"". It was crowded to the point of being dangerous especially in the little kid sections. I could not imagine that they didn't go over their legal occupancy and that it wasn't a health hazard. We had all-day tickets but left early because we couldn't take it anymore...hour-long lines for the few attractions they have; 45-minute waits for the changing rooms and bathrooms. And the tickets are so cheap compared to other water parks because the food is ASTRONOMICALLY priced...NINE CHICKEN NUGGETS and a bucket of fries for THIRTY DOLLARS!!! Never again!",1
1749,"Let me tell you about this Red Lobster... they do a great job!


I ordered the lobster Maine with steak- this option gives you a choice of the filet mignon or Strip. I went with the strip . This meal comes with a salad. I ordered the caesar... and Mojitos.

My steak (medium...slightly more to the medium rare) was cooked perfectly! Very juicy. My lobster tail was delicious. The Caesar was very good as well. This meal will run you about $40, not including the mojitos.


The only reason this review receives 4 instead of 5 stars is due to my drinks, and the server. The drink wasn't terrible, but for the price they really skimped on the additives, which of course impacts taste. I love mojitos, and was disappointed by the scattered pieces of the single leaf of mint inside. 

I do not have the serve name for this review... however... a tall, tanned complexioned gentleman. My server responded and served, but was very standoffish and slightly abrupt in general. I observed him at other tables, this was his approach for all guests . He may need to be in the back doing something that does not involve customer interaction- like dishes 


... but for that steak... I will be back  just not during his shift",4
1750,"By fluke I had lunch at Lit Italian Wine Bar. First, I love this downtown area. There are some many shops to peruse and such a great outdoor cafe scene!

My diet these days is pretty strict. Gluten free-vegetarian you would think makes dining out difficult. Surprisingly not the case. I am discovering that most restaurants now have gluten free options.

Sine it was lunch time, and the sun was out shining, and there happen to be a table available outside, my lunch date and I opted for salads!

I had the caprese salad and my date had the ahi tuna salad. The caprese salad had a beautiful blend of juicy red and yellow tomatoes with fresh basil and bococcini and the most flavourful olive oil I had ever tasted! It was the perfect size and was so satisfying!

The tuna salad had beautiful lightly seared tuna medallions with greens and raspberries. We were also given complimentary popcorn too!

They do have gluten free pasta as an option for their pasta dishes.

The place is small yet perfectly laid out and situated downtown. The service was pleasant and quick and the price was RIGHT! I would definitely go again and recommend this place for a nice outdoor lunch, after work wine, or weekend relaxing!",4
1751,"This place has much better-than-average bar food. I love the outdoor seating area, since it can get pretty packed and loud inside. Decent beer selection, and a great place to go if you do want to see a soccer game.",4
1752,"Voted one of the most romantic restaurants in Santa Barbara. It could have been if it wasn't for a wedding reception when we went... There were kids running and place was very loud. Not the restaurant's fault, of course.

Food is just OK.. nothing spectacular.. I need a redo.",3
1753,"I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.

I purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. 

After sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my ""finished car"" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. 

After all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said ""I don't know"" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got ""I don't know"". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get ""serviced"". 

Invest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part.",1
1754,The Mole is outstanding.  Tequila ice cream is killer.  Bring your own cerveca and skip the chain Mexican place down the road.  This is the real deal.,4
1755,"This place is insanely GREAT. The sandwiches are fresh, the menu is vast. If you're looking for an excellent sandwhich and don't have a lot of time, this is the place for you! The staff is amazing and attentive. They remember their customers/lunch orders after a while. I can't say enough about my experiences at Citi Market.",5
1756,Great coffee and in a good location.  Come here regularly and the staff are always nice,5
1757,"This place isn't what it used to be.  We were out to dinner a little later than usual, so our favorite place was going to be closing soon (Ting Wong) and figured we'd give Lee How Fook a try.  We used to go here a few years ago, but now I now why we must have left.  The Peking Spare Ribs lacked flavor, the Salt Baked Squid was dry and chewy and the Chinese Broccoli was way too salty.  Food seemed fresh, just not very well prepared.  We'll try someplace else, next time we're too late for Ting Wong.",2
1758,"So I meant to just go in and get a croissant or danish here (since I've been looking for a decent one here in reno), but managed to get distracted and buy a bunch of other things to try instead (because all their options looked delicious). 

I ended up with a poppy seed pastry, a baguette and coconut cake. All were pretty amazing. The coconut cake was light and not overly sweet and I 100% will need to go back to satisfy my sweet tooth.",5
1759,"Let me start off by saying that this place is the Chipotle of sushi.  Came here when they first opened and the food was ok.  Recently came back and notice the quality of the food was not the same.  The fish and the toppings didn't look as fresh. Couldn't pin point which ingredients made each bit taste like ""trash juice"".   For the price they should not serve there food in plastic bowls the size of an ice cream cup.  I get it, this is not California or Hawaii but I don't think I will be back for a third time.",1
1760,"Don't waste your time or money! They can never get an order right, they are slow and most of the kids that work there are rude!",1
1761,"Topa topa, amazing open space with great beers. The Weekender Session IPA is my favorite beer in town!! I love the open tab system!!!

However... if you sit at the bar there is a serious bleach smell that is overwhelming from the glass dishwasher. I'm not even sure bleach should be used in a high temperature dish cleaner, since the high temp kills the bleach...hope they can fix this, it's a major turn off when you're trying to enjoy the smell and taste of your beer.",4
1762,"The food was okay. The order was wrong. Ordered online and had it delivered, there were no napkins, utensils, etc. Not happy.",2
1763,"Another favorite. This place is my home away from everything. It is hard to leave because I am truly treated like one of their own.  Toni, Carla, Jackie, and Brian are the very best at what they do. I love them and they love me... they prove that every visit with service, presentation,  and food that will make you forget your name.",5
1764,"I am honestly so appalled​ at the service and standards at this place. Regardless​ of the food quality (which is fine for New Orleans), the service is horrible!

Lilian was our server and it took her at least 8 minutes to greet us and take our orders​. Water came about 5 minutes later and she just placed the waters down on the table and threw some straws down while she was at it. No ""here you go"" or smile on her face. 

Meanwhile, a gentleman​ came and offered us food that we never ordered... guess he meant to go to a different table. 

When our appetizers​ came, another woman yelled out ""avocado rolls"" *doesn't wait for anyone to claim them, she just puts them on the table* ""Shrimp roll"" *slides on table*, ""Shrimp​ and pork roll"" *slides on table* and then 1 of 3 drinks arrives and it just go slam dab in the middle of the table with no regard​ as to who ordered it. Generally, its bad enough to offer food to a table, waiters should always know who ordered what, but to just throw it on the table like that is straight RUDE!!!!!!

Two of the other drinks came after the food (just generally a bad standard of service to have food come before drinks). 

Food finally came, and it was fine. Employees were too busy to even clear tables to seat parties waiting at the door. The kicker was, they sat two parties of two at a table of four.... basically, ​these poor people had to share a table that is normally just a table for 3-4, not a communal table. 

My friends and I already discussed tipping at or below 15% for the sh*t service (was taking way too long to get our table cleared and our check) but we noticed a 20% gratuity added to the bill because they add that for parties of four or more (literally​ nowhere on earth adds the charge for 4+, its always at minimum 6+, and some places even do 18% not 20%). 

I asked a waitress to take it off because it is illegal to force a customer to pay ""gratuity"" and she argued with me for a minute before taking it off. Oh and also the gratuity is included in the tax calculation so you pay tax on the gratuity... ALSO ILLEGAL!! 

Scammy business with trash servers who literally​ do not give a crap about their job. I would only go back if the automatic gratuity was removed and the service improves. Obviously, ​it affects​ the work ethic of the waiters because they know they automatically get 20% in the bag if a table of 4+ comes in and therefore​ lose motivation to provide good service.",1
1765,"Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap

The good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb af

The meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican station

The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine

Tried 3 times and failed",2
1766,"Stopped in around midnight on a Friday. No cover, which is always nice. The interior is cool and classy. I really liked the live piano music, a good change of pace for sure. The place was kind of empty though for a Friday, which made it a little boring. I ordered a gin and soda and it was pretty standard. I would give this place another shot, hopefully it would be more packed because it has a lot of potential. Maybe it was just an off night. No real complaints though.",3
1767,"Been here a few times. Second time I used them, my sweater came back with a hole in it. I chalked it up to just bad luck and didn't blame them. It was a delicate sweater. 

Next time I used them, they stored my clothes under the wrong name and number ( quite a hard thing to do since I had picking up clothes at the same time I dropped those off, and they already had my name up in their system). Tip: Never lose your green slip or you may never see your clothes again!!

When I got home,  I inspected my black and white formal dress. They ruined it. The white had grey stains all over it. When I brought it back to show them, the blamed it on ""dirt that got inside the lining of the dress"". Apparently, I rolled around in the dirt in my formal dress so much that it got trapped between layers of sewn together fabric. This ""dirt"" conveniently was invisible to the naked eye until it was dry-cleaned. 

When I asked to speak to the owner, they said to call ahead the next day to make sure he's in before I come. I told them that I would come at noon and to let the owner know that. The next day I call at 11:30 to remind them. They tell me that there's no need to talk to the owner. He confirmed that it was dirt inside the dress and has left. They can fix it but that it will be hard and expensive. How convenient. Ruin my dress and then up-charge me clean it again, all the whole complaining about how hard it will be to clean. Now that's customer service. 

Off to find a new dry-cleaner",1
1768,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. We had the poke (so fresh and delicious) I got the special basil pesto shrimp pasta which was insanely tasty, boyfriend had THE STACK and the pork was super sweet and the slaw on top created exciting flavor profiles! We got the macadamia nut ice cream to finish which was also super good. The owner is also the chef, she came out and introduced herself and personally invited us to the events this weekend! Everything is locally sourced and made from scratch. The portions are correctly sized so if you're looking for a 10lb pile of food to be plopped in front of you, maybe order more than one thing. EVERYTHING IS FANTASTIC.",5
1769,"Pizza was really bland, didn't taste like much at all. Also the order was delivered 30 min late.",2
1770,"Good was acceptable, desert was the best a berry dish with ice cream and a cream puff, the best part of the meal. Waitress and service was very good. Food both my wife's and mine came out warm and that's being generous. Taste was decent and onion soup was very good.",3
1771,"My experience with this truck is mixed.  Veg couscous seemed healthy but was pretty bland. Smoked salmon sandwich (with egg, radish, caviar) was great.

Service can be very slow at times -- sometimes he chats for extended periods with certain people.",4
1772,"Best ice cream on the beach by far! Went in and they had just ran out of the homemade waffle cones so I had my ice cream in a cup. While my family and I were eating our ice cream across the street by the beach, the man working at Paradise Sweets came over with a fresh waffle cone and another scoop of the ice cream that I was eating. Customer service like that should allow me to give this place an extra five stars. Will absolutely continue to return for ice cream here.",5
1773,"Okay! This is my last for Landry's! I tried, I really did. See after the icky experience on my first review and the monthly delay on a mgr contacting me, I decided to be fair and see if I could leave the restaurant satisfied...on my terms. See when the district mgr finally called me he offered to set up a ""VIP service"" dinner, that all I had to do was call the mgr and make a reservation...I declined. It would be a fake set up just to make me happy, no thank you. 

Sooo...the bf was craving fish...and I had a hankering for oysters, he mentioned Landry's. We figured hey its 3 blocks down lets go. His first time and my last chance that I was giving...

We walked in, no hostess. She was standing in the middle of the dining room. She saw us...it was not even halfway filled...she took her sweet time to come over, grabbed menus and just asked if it was 2 of us. No 
problem. We were seated. Our server was Emma or Emily. I dont recall, she was as sweet as can be BUT didn't know anything when I asked about oysters. I ordered them anyway against my better judgement...they tasted fishy. Not fresh!!!! I doused them in cocktail sauce. The salad 
with the house dressing was delicious...of course had to request the garlic bread, hands down top 5 best. I ordered crabcakes and he did a sirloin with  a salmon fillet. The plates came out and she made a big emphasis on the plates being hot...they were. But my first bite was lukewarm at best. WHY THE HELL IS THE PLATE HOTTER THAN THE FOOD? my bf's was the same way. His steak was dry, salmon was undercooked and salty
 as hell. Emily asked how everything was and i answered ok. She asked if i wanted a manager, i assured her it wasnt her but no. I have this thing about sending food back. 

We left tipsy tho! The captain's punch was divine as always. However at the end of the day I can't  come here for salad, bread and drinks. The food isnt fresh and clearly reheated. Its overpriced for the crap u get. I really tried. And for it being the bf first time too, he gave it 2 stars.",2
1774,"Trying to find a restaurant in The Big Easy that serves vegetarian is not an ""Easy"" feat

We've encountered many the restaurant who would tell us time & time again that they did not have or *would* not make something to accommodate veggie needs & it was such a letdown.....to this day I still remember 1 guy saying ""Vegetarian?  Aww, you gotta get out earrrrrly for *that*"".  We still laugh about it....

Well, over the last few years, we're noticing more & more places recognizing veggies like to eat Southern / Cajun comfort food & they are starting to open up their menus to us! ( YAY)

Seeing that Muriel's Jackson Square had such an offering, we made rezzies to ensure we veggies got fed - you'll want to do this too - veggie or not!  They were packed & quoting 2 hr waits & this was at 9pm!

Started w/ drinkys at the bar - Sazerac for the Mr & I had the uber-delish Honey Child cocktail: honey-infused vodka & muddled blackberries.  The Mr liked mine so well that he ordered 1 too, to go w/ dinner & just to be nice, I had another as well so he wouldn't have to drink alone

Their veggie appie had eggplant, of which I'm not a fan so we asked the waitress if they could make their Goat Cheese Crepe, veggie & she said sure.  Since the description said it was topped w/ crawfish, we thought, this would be easy..... but unfortunately, the roulade sauce was made seafood stock. ACK!  Wished you had told us this!  The Mr however, said the crepe was nice & plump, the goat cheese was creamy & smooth & he liked it, barring the sauce

Mains consisted of their Veggie Soiree - this was a sampling of little dollops of veggie tastes - some you'll find on their side dish offerings & some not

Divine beets & roasted acorn squash

Polenta topped w/ chickpeas & a basil sauce - flavorful though those beans were crunchy & could have used a bit more time in the cooker.... same w/ the crunchy wild rice

Yams were very flavorful & had lots of ginger - the Mr got to indulge in both our dollops of chard - I tried a bite & it triggered my dislike for cooked greens

Too full for dessert, we left w/ happy tummies & thankfulness for a nice veggie night out.  A-OK night!",3
1775,Had a grilled chicken sandwich on bun to go. Couldn't hold sandwich due to bottom bun being soggy.  So I decided to just eat the meat.  I saw a piece of hair as I removed the meat. I haven't ate there in years and will not eat there again.  Zero stars from me.,1
1776,"I had fudge covered Oreo and I wasn't too excited about it. It was very creamy and rich, which some love but I'm not a big fan of. The place is cute and well priced.",3
1777,"Stay away. My husband and I stopped here this afternoon to use a gift card given to us a long time ago. We do not normally buy cold stone ice cream, and we're pretty easy to please. All we were looking for was a nice cold treat on a hot day- what we got was a small ice cream that was way too sweet (yes, even for ice cream!), and a chocolate shake that was not good, for about $11. My husband took one sip of his shake and pushed it away. I took a taste and agreed that something was not right. It had a distinctly sour, bitter aftertaste. While I finished my ice cream, he debated about whether he wanted something else instead. Since the ingredients seemed to be the problem, he decided did not want something else, even though my ice cream seemed fine. When I took the shake back to the register and explained the problem, we were told we could not receive a refund, only a replacement. Both of us had an upset stomach for about two hours afterwards, and neither of us had more than a sip or two. Poor customer service, bad ingredients. Food poisoning is not worth $11, so we simply left.

Poor customer service is my biggest pet peeve- as someone who has worked in customer service and international sales for four years, I promise you- it's really not THAT difficult of a task to make sure your customer is happy, even if there is a language/geographical barrier (today, there was neither). While I realize that the employee I spoke to is probably a minimum wage high school student, store policies that young woman has to follow are set by real adults. Whoever set the policies for this store clearly is not doing their job!

Shame on you, coldstone, for trying to give my (active-duty & a veteran) husband food poisoning on Memorial Day, and refusing to make any real attempt to make amends. Don't worry, you sure as hell won't see us again, ever. Fool me once....",1
1778,Amazing Bagels!! My favorite place ever! Super fast cook and donuts are fresh and they taste so good!,5
1779,"the ""famous"" apple pie, is poor. just a large mound of cool apple slices, no flavor, just mushy. its all just schtick. was my second time there, neither was impressive, memorable, etc. better dessert options in the area if you just walk around. 

the employees were at best, disinterested. 

and to top it off, they over charged my credit card.",1
1780,"very clean establishment. the service was friendly enough, the food was piping hot, and the roti was delicious! good vegetarian options and they label which of their dishes are safe for vegans, gluten-free, lactose-free, etc.

as said by others, this is basically indian fast food. i would recommend it!",4
1781,"I think the workers here are stoned and bone eyed. I ordered delivery, after almost 2 hours I called and asked about my order. At first they said it was on the way. The second time I called they said they had no record of my order and could not ""find"" it in the system. I stupidly ordered again and they never showed up. 420 weed is tight! I wish I could give a rating lower than zero, these guys would get a negative 5.",1
1782,"Very disappointed.  Decor was okay. Cathedral ceilings and open floor plan.  Seemed like an appropriate venue for a wedding reception.   Menu had way to many choices. Two pages for just starters. Hard to make up your mind. ""Less is more"".  Service was okay. I ordered a seafood salad as my entree, my friend ahi tuna (seared) and my other friend a chicken sandwich.  We also ordered 3 starters for the table. Spicy shrimp dish (can't remember the name), tuna ceviche and edamame.  Its is really hard to mess up edamame, so that was okay. We did not finish the ceviche, it had no taste at all. The shrimp starter was the high light of the meal. Very good!  My seafood salad was really sad.  I felt like a rabbit eating dry vegetables. I told my server that I wanted to change my dressing to just plain lemon and olive oil. The salad came out with no dressing at all. My friends ahi tuna was pretty bad. Just did not taste fresh and the sauce for dipping was bland. My other friend enjoyed his chicken sandwich. I have two things to say. 1-they seemed to have put more attention into the way the food looked on the plate then the flavor of the food.  The plating was above average.  2- if you go, try to stick to basic dishes that are hard to mess up,  for example there seared ahi tuna dish was a disaster, but there grilled chicken sandwich was good.  Anything on the menu over $15 stay away from.   I most likely will not return unless I hear that they have consolidated there menu and changed the flavor profile to most of there dishes.  Btw my friends got 2 ice coffee lattes and they where $5 each. That seemed a little pricy, I could be wrong.",2
1783,"Very nice, quiet and dark restaurant. Chinese and sushi offered. Had szechuan chicken, hot and sour soup, and steamed rice. Hubbie had the prime rib and shrimp hot pot. Just the right amount of food. Didn't have to take any home. Service was excellent.",5
1784,Super awesome!!! Super loaded tacos and they were amazing great customer service I absolutely love this place,5
1785,"Save your money go to El Rodeo across the street.  I love mexican food, I was eager to try this place.   It gets 2 start because the food was fast, edible and hot.  Charged for sour cream..seriously?  It's like going to Logan's and getting charged for steak sauce.  Rice or beans on items instead both with meal.  Charge for more chips and salsa...most have unlimted.  Menu does not describe items unknown to others.  Flavor of the beef was bland, no seasoning.   Taco bell has better flavor and no charge for sour cream.  I saw a staff member adjust his crotch.  Manager had old stained food clothes.  Table was dirty like they only cleaned what was seen...makes me wonder.",2
1786,"Cash only seemed to be the theme around Orleans, so that part wasn't surprising.  
The presentation of the food was nice.
Flavor was just OK, nothing to brag, I think I'd go back.",3
1787,"The food was ok but it was the service that was awful. We had to wait over 45 minutes just to get out food. And when we did get our food it was missing the fries, which didn't come until we were ready to leave. When you wait that long for food it kind of ruins it.",2
1788,"Based on the reviews and price point I had high expectations. Hotel Monteleone did not deliver. 

My husband and I arrived around 2 pm and our room wasn't ready. We left our baggage and the staff actually asked us for a tip- which I thought was rather bold and distasteful. We didn't get a call until after 4 pm that our room was ready, which was a little less than ideal after a long day of travel.

When we finally got to our room we asked for our bags to be sent up and didn't get them until my husband went to the front desk to ask about them. They had tried bringing them to the wrong room and then argued with my husband- saying that they were not in fact our bags.

The room was okay- but not wildly impressive. We had a great view, dated decor, non-working phones. The bathroom was absolutely incredible and was a highlight for us.

It was a hassle to get wifi and bottled water. The employees were not particularly friendly or helpful.

The bar was pretty cheesy and extremely crowded. We skipped it and just went into town. This is in a fabulous location and extremely walkable.

We ordered late night room service- which we weren't expecting to be great. However, this was beyond bad. From the very limited menu, we got a pizza that was simultaneously extremely burnt and cold.

The absolute kicker was spotting a cockroach in the hallway! I definitely didn't sleep soundly and felt wildly disappointed with our stay.",2
1789,Service was fantastic at the sushi/bar area! Not to mention delicious sushi and drinks!,5
1790,"A little tired and worn with packs of teenagers mingling about, however for a local community theater it is OK. I personally prefer the super deluxe theaters they are opening up with recliners, however this place remains constant.",3
1791,I love the habit!  When ever I have friends and family come over they always remember this place from the last visit and want to go there right away.  I personally love getting a cheeseburger with chili cheese fries and a vanilla malt.  It is so good and their service is good.  I also enjoy eating outside but they do not have an indoor dinning area but the food is way worth it.  I love the habit!!,5
1792,"It's no secret that backyard bowls is a favorite in town, and with reason.  Their acai bowls are really good, everything is fresh and tasty!  All of the bowls I have tried are great and they can be very filling.  The large is A LOT.  Minus one star just because it's pretty pricey so it's not something I get on a regular basis.",4
1793,"I came across Newk's Eatery at the Lobster Festival that was held at the Kapok Tree venue in Clearwater. I read good reviews about the restaurant so I was glad to see them there. The food was very good especially the Shrimp salad that my new friend and I had. Plus the Lobster Bisque was excellent.

However, the service was not. Closed to closing of the festival my friend who was a vendor there told me that they had lowered their prices. So I want over there. The manager told me the price for the shrimp salad went down to $7.00 from $10.00. So I purchased two of them. I should have been charged $14.00 plus tax. You would think so. Instead the manager charged me the full price and it came out to be $21.50. Big difference. I complained to the manager at the booth and she did nothing. I called the store later and spoke to Tim the manager on duty and explained it to him and he told me to call back on Monday. I call the store on Monday and spoked to the General Manager who happened to be the same person that was at the booth at the show and she said she would refund my money. I was only interested in the difference between what I was charged and what I should have been charged.
The manager said she would give me a full refund. That was Monday. It is now Thursday and I am still waiting.",1
1794,"This was the first time I have ever been here and I have lived in the area my whole life. I have always wanted to try them out but couldn't convince the wife to try them out. So finally for my birthday/anniversary, we went. And what a let down. We arrived at 4:30. Parking lot only had two or three cars and a couple were leaving as we pulled in. I know this is a small place and does get full fast so we decided to go early to beat the crowd. First thing we are asked if we had a reservation. No. There were only two other tables seated in the main dinning room when we arrived and they were wrapping up to leave. Since we did not have a reservation we were told we could not sit in the main dinning room as they have many many reservations after 5pm. Ok, it was only 4:30. So we are seated in a small room between the bar and the main dinning room... next to the stand where the silverware and napkins are kept. With in a matter of about 10 minutes a couple of other tables came in who apparently had reservations, including a party of 8 who all got seated next to us... in the small room. 

Food was ok. I ordered Sourbroten (spelling?) and my wife ordered the Stroganoff. The salad was good. The food did not taste fresh. The beef was tender in mine. The Stroganoff tasted as if it was reheated sauce poured over reheated meat. The spaetzle, though I thought was good, had no flavor and was only warm on both of our plates. Everything tasted like it needed some salt. Our expectation for arriving early for an early dinner was that the food would have been really fresh and nice and hot. My wife didn't like her dinner at all and ended up leaving more than half. We ended up taking the left overs in a box that never ended up getting eaten anyway. 

The deserts were way overpriced for what they had to offer so we ended up elsewhere in town for desert. We were rushed through our meal and were out of there in under an hour. When we left at 5:30, only about 5 other tables occupied the restaurant, with only two in the main dinning room. The place was otherwise empty. So where were all of these ""many many reservations after 5pm"" we will never know.

We might go back to give them a second chance, but it will be a while. Next time we will remember to make a reservation so we can, maybe get a nicer table away from all of the clankity clank of the bus boy rummaging through the silverware right next to me. I don't know if we came on a bad day (a Sunday evening) or what, but the service was not the friendliest, the owner was the one who greeted us with ""since you don't have a reservation we have to sit you here"" attitude. I hear folks always raving about this place. Just didn't happen here.",2
1795,"Great place for a quick burger.  I like the quick seating, upbeat atmosphere & menu.

My favorite is the turkey burger with sirachi sauce & bottomless sweet potato fries :)

The appetizers are very good & decent prices for the value.

Will return :). RED ROBIN lol....sticks in my head",4
1796,"After much deliberation, mostly due to sour reviews here on Yelp, I decided to get my burger on last night. We arrived to find a lot of people hangin' out front waiting. Curses! The Yelpers were right I thought. However, we tempted the gods and continued in. Asked the hostess if there was a wait, and we were promptly seated outside on the patio after zero waiting. The only caveat, we can't order alcohol on the patio: no big deal.

Our server was swamped and he made sure to let us know he would be back around to us. After about five minutes he returned, and we ordered the fried pickle chips, crab cakes, Pimento burger, and the Woodstock. The pickle chips were great, the crab cake was spiced out and delish. Both of our burgers were cooked exactly how we ordered, and we left happy and with our gullets full. 

tl;dr: new restaurant - good food - had no problems - would recommend",4
1797,"We've been to this place once or twice and had an OK time, but will DEFINITELY not be back again. We arrived with a party of 5 on a Friday at 5:30 PM and were seated at a hibachi after about five minutes. The place was busy but not awfully so. We sat for about ten minutes and then had our drink orders taken. After another ten minutes, drinks arrived, and our food orders were taken. Then we waited for twenty minutes, were forced to move to another table so that a larger group could have our grill, and were finally brought salads and soup.. forty minutes later. We eventually left the restaurant after AN HOUR of sitting, waiting for a chef to show up. The manager, who'd told us when he moved us that we'd have a chef in a matter of minutes, absolutely knew that we'd been waiting forever yet still acted clueless when we told him we were leaving, like it was just a normal thing that you'd wait for AN HOUR before someone even shows up to make your dinner. No apology, no nothing. Our server was at least apologetic and understanding. Suck it, Toyama, I'd give you ZIP STARS if I could.",1
1798,Man this place was fire !!!!! The devil eggs to start off were fabulous!!! And for a meal I got the red beans and rice and they were just spicy enough but not to hot !!!! My wife got the macaroni and cheese and I tried some and have to say that it's probably the best I have ever had. Also I tried the roast beef pot boy and it was great too. Drinks are great and great atmosphere just all around a great place to go. Come see Jeff when u come in he was great as well. Also my buddy had the the oysters raw and he said they was really good as well. Must try this place out,5
1799,"I fell in love with Silver Mine the moment my freshman taste buds came in contact with their freshly baked bread and perfect blend of herbs.

My favorite sandwich is the Dodge City, a salami, pepperoni, provolone sandwich that leaves you feeling as greasy as if you had just sprayed yourself with a thin mist of vasoline, but most everything on the menu will leave you without the ability to control your eating speed.

Is Silver Mine the best sandwich joint in Tucson?  No, that's reserved for East Coast Super Subs at twice the price.  But Silver Mine comes in at number 2.  A less expensive, almost as tasty option.",3
1800,Got the massage package which included mani-pedi and blowout. Great price for all those services. My hair is thick so they ended up charging extra for that so just be aware. The massage was fantastic - ask for Tara if you go.,5
1801,"Not how you expect a business to be ran, un professional on so many levels. Just open your eyes and pay attention. Food is great, the cooks are just way to in consistent on cooking and presentation for the price you have to pay. Will never return back.",1
1802,"I stopped in here on my way to another restaurant, it looked that good. I got in and scanned the menu. But the only thing I could see was the Fatty Filet. Nothing else would register. So, after I clarified what the waitress the explanation of what Tobacco fries where, I made my order. 
Delicious.
Not sure what else they sell, but the Fatty was spectacular.",4
1803,Awesome joint... music and style is worth the cover alone. Previous reviews complaining about cover charges think musicians magically make money when they play. That's right...the covers go to the musicians. Stop being a cheap skate!! This place is a must stop for locals and tourists alike!!,5
1804,"I consider myself a sushi snob, and I was a bit concerned by the 3.5 star rating... and then we showed up to an empty restaurant on a Saturday night... Total red flag, but my 5 friends all wanted to stay. And I'm so glad they did! Wow!

The food was amazing! They did a great job with the chirashi, miso soup, ""monkey brains"" (fried mushrooms), hamachi nigiri, and a crazy awesome roll called the Imperial Dragon or something like that, which showed up at our table in a dragon-shaped foil wrap and ON FIRE!  It was so good that we had to order a 2nd one. 

The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is value. The sushi is more expensive than average, and the $20 chirashi only came with 6 pieces of sashimi (+2 masago and 2 crab sticks), much fewer than every other place I've been to.

The rice was great though, in spite of what some other reviews may say. And the staff and service were great too!",4
1805,Great way of training your dog. Our puppy was really difficult. He was very aggressive with everybody even us. We took hhim for a boot camp for 2 weeks and came back a nee dog. We really recommend Sit Means Sit.,5
1806,"Definitely try the  beef yakamein. Delicious. Super savory, simple. I wish I had the recipe. A great soup, any time of day.",5
1807,"Lousy service, crap food and$21 for four shrimp...  And they are find with that when i talked to them about it.. I didn't even eat half

Garbage",1
1808,"We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.",5
1809,"My date and I popped in to Los Jefes for a late afternoon lunch recently, hoping that this colorful Mexican joint would be a new addition to our taco and fajita rotation.  Our hopes were dashed after a less than stellar experience.

My main beef is regarding the service.  Although the place was not that busy, it took forever to  1.) be greeted, 2.) to receive our drinks, 3.) to have our orders taken and 4.) to receive refills of chips and salsa.  The drinks we ordered were just the basic house frozen margaritas, nothing special or extra, literally comes out of a daiquiri machine.  On top of all that, our orders did not arrive both at once.  This is a huge pet peeve for me when dining out because it feels rude to me to start digging into my meal when others at my table are still waiting on their food.  

I was hoping that the food and drinks would excuse the poor service, but honestly, I've had better elsewhere.  It's awesome that you get a free order of queso when checking in with the Yelp app, but it came out cold!  The redfish tacos were tasty enough, but for the price, I wish there could have been more fish.  The margaritas were okay, but again, I've had better at other restaurants.

If a restaurant is going to earn a return visit from me, it needs to be consistent on both it's service and food.  Los Jefes gave me neither.  On a side note, the owner stopped by our table and thanks us for dining there, which was cool.  Unfortunately, this gesture is not enough for me to eat here again.",2
1810,A Christmas carol exceeded my expectations.  The set designs blew me away. Characters costumes and stage presence were excellent,5
1811,"South Street's Night Market, 8/15/13 (see photos):

I've been traveling, so this was the first Night Market I've made since Chinatown last year.  Got there early, 6-ish, to try to beat the inevitable lines.  The traffic heading down Pine St was a disaster (whether due to South Street being closed, the Eagles game, or maybe it always is at rush hour).  I tried to park in that big indoor lot on Lombard between 2nd & 3rd, but it was full (did find one of the last spaces across the street, TG).

Getting to Night Market early is definitely a good plan, since after an hour the lines start to get really long for the best trucks.  But went with the flow and had a great time anyway.

Award for longest lines (too long to wait in): A tie between Cheu Noodle Bar (presumably for those killer wings), and the Surf and Turf Truck (lobster rolls).

Highlight of the night: Chatting with Marc Vetri as he sweated for his money at the Alla Spina tent (see photo).  Pretty good Sangria, Marc!

Also tried:

FOO TRUCK'S roast pork bahn mi crostini--perhaps the best thing all evening

FREECON FARMS' Crabby Granny cider--a nice big refreshing glass

LITTLE BABY'S ICE CREAM for peanut butter, maple, tarragon ice cream--Yum!

POI DOG SNACK SHOP for an authentic Hawaiian spam musubi (why Haiwaii consumes 80% of the world's SPAM supply!)

http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2008/04/tutorial-how-to-make-hawaiian-spam-musubi-sushi.html

STREET FOOD PHILLY...I can't remember what

SUPPER'S SCRATCH BISCUITS for a roast pork and pineapple salsa biscuit sandwith--great biscuit, but large and dry due to too little filling

TACO MONDO's Thai chicken taco--excellent

XOCHITL's margarita--pretty decent

About 1 1/2 hours to walk from Front to 9th street.  Definitely one of the ""must dos"" of the Philly food scene, but get a couple of beers to keep you company while you wait in line.

If you want to see what the vibe is like, the Inky's Dawn Fallik has a good video here:

1812,"Writing this review in the middle of the night because, for the second night in a row, my children and I were awakened by a false fire alarm. And there've been 2 alarms go off tonight. This just after somehow miraculously having fallen asleep despite hallway doors banging open and shut nonstop and a room heater/AC unit that sounds just like a semi tractor idling each and every time the fan turns on. As a bonus, the parking lot (5 floors below) sounds like it's turned into an actual truck stop -- all which you can easily hear. So tired.",1
1813,"As a native New Englander - longtime Florida transplant myself, having been raised and brought up with these cold water crustaceans among the many other seafood delicacies, forever shaping my palate and spoiling me to anything else calling itself a Lobster. (Yes, You...Florida/Caribbean Spiny Lobster or perhaps shall I just call you a Giant Crayfish!?!) I have been a repeat and loyal customer at Lobster Haven for almost 2 years running now, since my office is just down the road. Lucky Me! I am always at my happiest when I know I can rely on an Authentic New England Seafood Market/Shanty near me. Oh and did I mention Affordable?!?!

I can't think of a visit where the Lobster Haven staff has not been helpful in assisting me in plucking out my Lobsters from one of their many tanks along with their fresh Ipswich Steamer Clams just chillin' in their very own cozy tanks. They'll steam them up for you right there should you choose, bring them home or relax at one of the few tables within this Lobster Shack or in their newer room to accommodate a larger party.

Among the traditional New England staples such as Ipswich Clams, Maine Lobster, Sea Scallops, Cod, Haddock &/or freshly made Clam Chowder, etc... They carry a ridiculous variety of other fresh and frozen Seafood from our Gulf Coast Region, i.e.; Spiny Lobster Tails, Key West Pink Shrimp, Royal Red Shrimp, Grouper, Snapper, Redfish, Mahi Mahi, Jumbo Prawns, etc... I also count on them during Crawfish season when I have a frequent craving for Spicy Louisiana Crawfish...And..Well.. Once again, they do not disappoint there either! $5.99 per lb last time I picked some up. (FYI - Just 1 week ago)

This place is a MUST for all seafood lovers and for those seeking a taste of New England, I'll just say how very grateful I am to have this establishment in town - much more convenient then having fly up north every time I desire a taste of Boston!",5
1814,"Food wasn't bad. This place just showed its true colors as to why the franchise might be struggling. Our server was just fine, just didn't seem to know any better but our appetizer came out half done. The other half was still frozen. They offered to give us another appetizer on the house but we declined. Then when my wife's food came out, her order was wrong too. They did allow her to keep the extra food & gave her the correct side quickly. Maybe if they got everything right the first time, they wouldn't have to give so much food away for free. My wife loves this place for some crazy reason. I think it is because when the food is done right, it isn't bad, especially at the price. Everyone has their bad days just don't prefer the food or the atmosphere",2
1815,"They have absolutely the best smoothies around.  Everything is fresh, [mostly] healthy, and delicious.  My only complaint was that some of the listings on the chalkboard menu were blocked by blenders.  The owners were aware of the problem (echoed by the person behind me) and were promising to correct the matter ASAP.  I will definitely be back!!",5
1816,"I went to this restaurant last week and ordered chat, vada and chillibajji. Bajji is good, chat is ok and vada is worst. They should also consider to improve sambar and chutney taste.",2
1817,"I basically created my account to talk about how much I loved this place. Everything we ordered tasted extraordinary and the staff was hella nice.  I had to change my reservation [NB: you should probably make a reservation if you want to come here because seating is limited] three times and they were super accommodating and friendly about everything (I don't even know if I would have been that friendly with me at that point).  The food was made to perfection.  I started out with the Burratta Cheese and Fried Green Tomato salad (YUM), which was a nice prelude to the Arctic Char and Lobster Fingerlings (which tasted like little bites of heaven.  I'm not even a big fish fan, but it is supposed to be good for you, blah, blah).  Did I mention it's BYO? Nuff said.",5
1818,"The food here is pretty good, but far from great. The highlight was the empanadas. They were very tasty. 

The puerco asado was decent, but dry. Parts of it seemed overcooked. The black beans that accompanied it were very tasty and combined with the pork added some much needed moistness. 

Overall, a good experience. Our server was very gracious and fairly attentive. There was one question about a menu item that took a couple of minutes to get an answer to, but she was knowledgeable about most of it.",3
1819,"Superior grill has by far the best Mexican food I've ever tasted!  Being in the military, I've lived in 6 different states, including California. No where even comes close to the quality of ingredients that superior uses in their food.  Steak quesadilla is off the charts!",5
1820,"I really wanted to like this place! I was looking forward to eating here for a long time. Finally decided to pull the trigger. When I had seen the menu, I was super excited. We ordered a few items from each category, we really wanted to get the full experience. Nothing really wow'd us at all. The concept, menu and food items are fantastic. The execution on the other hand was very weak. The food and flavors needs some work. I hope much success to them!",2
1821,"First off, I am not a tourist to New Orleans so when I make a reservation I expect to not be rushed through my meal when the restaurant is 1/2 empty and I know they aren't waiting to turn over the table to another customer. Second, I was appalled when the singing trio came to our table and placed thier carafe to put tips into right in front of me. Most restaurants have the entertainment located in one area and people can go up and request them to come to their table personally to entertain with a song or two and they can pay them. I understand the restaurant may have thought it was a nice touch to have them go table to table but lose the jar.  If people enjoy it and want to tip them, they will. I felt like a fool after they had come to my table because my guest and I only had credit cards, do they take that? No, and they looked at us like we had 10 heads when we didn't reach down into our purses to hand them cash. Third, my guests dinner was great, mine not so much. I had fish that tasted like it would have been excellent if it wasn't drowned in salt and spices. I am used to the New Orleans spices but this was too much. I wish I  had just ordered another Crabmeat Broussards appetizer (which was delicious) and a side. Last but not least, we had the profitterols for desert. They were very good and highly recommended by our server. But then as we were eating it, my guest realized that she was chewing on a wrapper. Mine did not have a wrapper underneath it so we assumed they weren't supposed to have them and we brought it to our servers attention and just got a 'sorry' from him. After the experience I had, I don't think I will be going back there any time soon, maybe just for drinks on the patio.",2
1822,"I've been here a few times and it's a really good sushi spot  
The buffet is OK and I'd recommend sitting at the bar for the best service.
Not the best place for kids unless they really like sushi",4
1823,If I could give this 0/5 stars I would. The front desk staff is EXTREMELY RUDE. They are unwilling to help with anything. They overcharge you for everything. Housekeeping threw away some of our personal belongings when they cleaned the room. We ended up moving to a different hotel during the middle of our stay. Stay away from Royal Sonesta!,1
1824,"Went in for gel manicure and regular pedicure. I had a Groupon deal - first of all, they said I couldn't avail that without an appointment, which is just rude!
Secondly, there were only 2 women who work here and when we went in with 2 mani pedis and 1 mani, they made it sound like we would get done in no time, but made us wait forever!
One of them was constantly on her phone or going outside repeatedly.
I would give it one more star if at least the quality was good - but the gel mani came off in a week. 
Would NOT recommend.",2
1825,"I got tired of not getting the haircut I wanted at a much fancier place, so I went to Yelp and found Justin's. I figured guys will over rate a restaurant when their bellies are full of meat and gristle, but not a barber shop. And, I was right !
I thought of just copy/pasting the other reviews because they are dead on, but thought I would add that this place is nothing new, in fact, it is something old. Old, as in simple, easy, friendly, not overdone.",5
1826,"I ordered to-go earlier today, half sandwich and side baked potato. The food was good but the croissant was burned black all around the edges and I had to scrape it off. I would order the sandwich again but ask for it not to be heated at all. I ordered the potato with butter, green onions and sour cream. Unfortunately, all I got was a potato with onions. No sour cream and no butter, which made for a very dry side dish. I ate half then threw the rest away because dry potatoes don't taste that great. This place has potential but I don't like having to fix so much myself and throwing away food because basic orders can't be followed. For over $11 I expected more from my dinner, I wasn't even full at the end",2
1827,"I signed up for Will's classes to help me get me back in shape before my wedding. Will is very motivating, knowledgeable and helpful inside the gym and out. Always available to give advice on nutrition, supplements and goes above and beyond to help you reach your goals. Will is great for anyone regardless of fitness level. He will figure out a plan and exercises that work for you.",5
1828,"A hidden gem in Westwego.  It's location is either strange or so obvious I'm jealous. It's right behind the famous shrimp lot.  A quaint simple looking house on the outside with a dash of dive.   

In the inside shares a feature that most dives have. Drop ceilings.  ;). Right on.   Though these guys have the fancier 7' version.  

In a nutshell this place is pretty cool.  The bartender, I shamefully forgot her name, is super friendly and fantastic.  

The atmosphere is that of any place near fishing camps or docks, mixed company but always fun.  Meaning super drunk old men and super drunk young guys. Well heeled tourist and the local handicapped fella.  All a recipe for fun.  
The AC works big time, also makes it pretty cool. 
Bottle beer selection is a little thin, other than the main three there is Corona and $1.25 Rolling Rock.  Good prices here, a round of three beers goes for $7.  If you buy everyone  in the bar Rolling Rock you'll only be out  $10. Look like a hero ;)

There is karaoke and bands on some nights.  Pool tables and a pile of old juke boxes and broken games in the corner. 
If your in the area, definitely stop in and get a seat at the bar. Nice super comfy retired Harrahs chairs ;)
Also if the bar across the street , Swamp Room is too loud, this is a very good alternative.   Or if this place is too quiet..you can go across the street.",3
1829,Amazing biscuits and (fill in the blank). Great cocktails too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though.,5
1830,"What a great little Theatre company hiding out in Kirkwood. It's small enough to minimize the crazy crowds of The Fabulous Fox, but it's large enough to make it worth the while. The stadium seating was great and the parking was a breeze. Not certain I'd recommend changing a thing. However I'd need to return a few more more time to fairly evaluate. But over all the sound and view was great.",3
1831,"Heard folks rave about their bagels and lox, but it was just okay, not the greatest.  The lox didn't have enough taste to it, no real ""punch"" for me to say that it was off the hook.  Don't get me wrong though, this place was good as some of my other friends ordered other things.  Surrey's is also known for their bananas foster french toast, which was pretty good.  Some of us also ordered the ""jungle punch or juice,"" which consisted of fresh juices, which I cannot recall anymore and cactus juice.  This had a rather interesting taste.  It tasted ""green"" and I don't know how to describe that.  I think it's an acquired taste, but I sure wouldn't order it.  Service was good, as the waitress came by to refill our water and my coffee.  Lastly, go early, as there are lines, but we lucked out and a table was ready when we got there.  On our way out, there was a line outside the restaurant.

I'd rate Surrey's a solid 3.5 star, not quite a 4 star in my books.",3
1832,"Coffee is usually hot & fresh. They love to up-sale you with every order, they ask you at least 3xs if you want hash browns or a donut & it gets annoying when you say all you want is your coffee!",3
1833,Fantastic! In town on business and found this place on yelp...food was outstanding.  Highly recommend the Vietnamese taco appetizer.  Only downside is BYOB/no alcohol.,5
1834,I'm blown away by how delicious my burger was! Best burger I've ever had and I'm 55 years old! Kudos to the chef! This place was recommended by someone on my friend's flight from Houston into St Louis. We are here for the Joyce Meyer conference.,5
1835,"I had bugs in my bed, the staff was very unfriendly and just denied it when I reported it.
They had not the courtesy to come to the room to see it for them self. 
Well then they put me in another room, next day again into another room; where the heater did not work. Just stay away from that place if you do not want to bring home any bugs.",1
1836,Made an online reservation and was seated promptly. Seat was for four and they put two tables together near the bar. It was noisy but that's to be expected on a Saturday night. Our server was wonderful and the food arrived on time. We had three chicken and one veg entrees. The food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend street noodles with some chefs hot sauce. But make sure to get a reservation or you'll have to wait 30mins.,4
1837,2nd trip to Nola and this was on my list. Old world charm meets modern day living. My 3rd trip to Nola and they had Mardi Gras decorations all over the lobby.  Beautiful 12 ft ceilings designed in a Beaux-Arts-style boutique Hotel.   When you walk through the doors the focal point in the lobby area is a huge grandfather clock.  Marble floors and antiques displayed around the lobby.  Famous authors frequented this hotel and now they can say Mel M of Yelp visits during every trip to Nola. Ha!,4
1838,"I'd give the Black Sheep another try. But next time, I'd do it in a group of less than 25 people. We came on a Thursday night, expecting to immediately take over the downstairs section at around 5:30PM. But come to find out, it did not open up until at least 7PM, even later depending on when the bartender got in and got set up.

Our server was as kind as she could be with a whole mess of rowdy professionals on their third beer, wanting to escape her section for the freedom and convenience of the downstairs bar.

Aside from the crowded conditions, and the sometimes surly service, the Black Sheep has plenty to offer from great beers on tap to pub food abounding to entrees straight out of Ireland. I'd been here for dinner before and had a relatively good experience then, so I'm not denying that you can have a great night at the Black Sheep. Just don't show up with 25 of your closest friends at happy hour and expect to find seats. It ain't happening.",3
1839,"My GF and I decided to get dinner here on a whim because we were hungry, and well, it was open. We were both distinctly underwhelmed with the food and the service. Our waiter took our order, but never came back to check on us until it was time to pay. The place was definitely kid friendly, which is fine, but it was downright raucous and noisy. My dinner was a squid ink pasta with scallops and shrimp, and the pasta was mostly stuck together (although the sauce was nice), and there were two small shrimp and two small scallops - all for 19 bucks. Next time we'll keep on walking.",2
1840,Band was dreadful!!!  Beers overpriced! Food was mediocre at best...The waitress was pleasant.  We won't be returning anytime soon,2
1841,Lorraine makes a mean blue mist pineapple head hookah. Very chill place. Love the country music with the hookah great twist!,4
1842,"We went here for a birthday party and had a blast.

Keep in mind this isn't a typical piano bar. There is minimal seating intentionally as it has more of a bar/club feel than a lounge. The place is pretty relaxed until about 10-11pm. Then they clear out tables for a dance floor. It has a very energetic vibe.

If you want seating you need to get there early, 6 or 7, and camp out. Treat your server well if you are going to kerping seats all night. Choose a table on the side or back so it doesn't get taken away later in the evening. On a Saturday there was no cover when we arrived at 8pm, making it convenient for friends who weren't with the birthday group.

Now for the birthday group reservation. The package offered free entry plus a drink per person and a few other perks. It ended up being very convenient for our group as it carved out an area where we can all comfortably hang out with seats as well as mingle with friends who showed up spontaneously. The personal service with the group reservation was fantastic. They take good care of the birthday group and make sure everyone always has a fresh drink in hand.",5
1843,"I bought a Jeep from this dealership about a month ago and that whole process was fairly easy and pain free. Kenny was my cars salesman. He was patient with my family and I as we were there hours test driving cars, crunching numbers, etc. The paperwork process was painless and easy although I was at the dealership for about 2 1/2 hours doing paperwork. Before leaving the lot make sure you THOROUGHLY check the cleanliness of your car! It may be shiny on the outside and appear clean on the inside but they do not truly scrub down the interior. My car still had pen marks on the interior cloth, easy to remove dirt stains, etc. When I wiped down the interior myself, my disinfectant wipe turned jet black! That's not clean. So have them wipe it down in front of you. Otherwise, a good experience",3
1844,"Decent lunch special. I really liked the veggies in the Kung Pow Chicken and it's got just enough spice (if you like spicy that is). Came in shortly after the lunch hour, they immediately started making my order and it was done probably 10 minutes later. I'll probably give it another try cause it was decent food... Maybe next time they can explain to me what the gluten free sign means, cause the gentleman who took my order sure didn't.",3
1845,Awesome place for a quick bite.... Loved the tuna melt sandwich and black bean soup!!! AAA+++,5
1846,"When I first walked in, it seemed an ok place but by the time I realized it was a mistake to get mani and pedi done here, it was too late.
I got shellac done and they applied 10-12 coats of paint and gel.  It started peeling off in 3-4 days.  My nails look all rough after the nail paint has peeled off.
Also, the people working there were talking to each other in Mandarin.  I felt really awkward there.
They used some neon green colored massage lotion or something.  Ewww.  I am never going back!",1
1847,"This is our second time going to capital cellars. I'm leaving my review based on price point and comparison to other similar priced venuses such as Brick 29, Chandlers, Ruth Chris and Alavita.  We had a salmon fish and a seafood risotto dish.  For appatizer we had a bowl of French onion soup, no doubt the best thing the entire night.  The salmon should have never made it to our table. Even a new chef would have know it was way over cooked and extremely dry.  The seafood risotto was ok but nothing I'd pay $20+ for.  This was our second go at the place and for sure our last.  I always give a place two attempts to get it right, capital failed on both.",2
1848,"This hotel was gross. There was a stinky cigarette smell on the second floor. The smoke detector was hanging from the ceiling, wires exposed. There was a layer of dust on the upper ledges of the tub. 

I was here pretty much to rest up for a cross-country trip. I slept 3 hours at most because of the smell--it permeated the bedsheets.

I give 2 stars to the friendly ladies and fellow who checked me in and out. They were nice people.",2
1849,"Ordered a pizza with pep and sausage, nothing to crazy.  Pizza itself was very good.  Service well I just wish I could go lower then 1 star.
Order was placed for delivery to a business less than 10 minutes away.  When ordered, was given a time of 45 minutes, pretty standard for a Friday.  
After an hour and 15 minutes went by I called to see where the pizza was.  I was placed on hold (again, not uncommon) then a guy who I could hardly hear answered and I told him I was checking an order status.  I was placed on hold again.  When he returned, I told him the order and he simply said, ""they left.""  That was it.  No timeframe of when they left, what the issue was, no apology, nothing.  I said ok and before finishing my thought, he said bye and hung up.  
15 minutes later the order arrived putting us at 1 hour and 30 minutes, double the original timeframe.  The pizza was tasty but cold.  The driver was friendly but offered no apologies and went on her way.  
Pretty safe to say that it is easier for me to order from Palermos (pick-up only) then wait for these guys.",1
1850,"We have had the pizza a bunch of times, and it's always reliable and ingredients are clearly high quality. Between $3-4/slice is very pricey though! I ordered two of their catering trays for a tailgate last month, and Adam was very helpful in advising how much to get for our group of 30. Sandwiches were a huge hit. Bagels were good, too. Salted caramel brownies (gluten free) were the best I've ever had. If not for the price point they'd be 5 stars.",4
1851,"Love this place! The atmosphere is very laid back, and the lavender vanilla latte was delicious! Perfect place to study or relax with a book.",5
1852,"Took 45 minutes to get the order. Everyone that came in after seemed to get their food before us. Both the burger and the onion rings were cold when i got it, felt like chewing through rubber. After letting them know they did let us have the burgers for free.",2
1853,"The wait is long and it is crowded, even late at night. I came in past 8 and waited over 30 minutes for a seat when it was cold and windy out. I would give it 5 stars if not for that seat! The Rock Crab is worth it, however; fresh and sweet with Caesar salad and a cup of hot lobster bisque on the side. The crab cakes are OK and so was the shrimp and scallop pasta.  The server was friendly, fast and helpful. She substituted the regular soup for  the bisque! 5 stars for her! A little pricey but a nice place for fresh, simple seafood fare.",4
1854,"Really looked forward to the meal here. Our server was wonderful and the ambience is fabulous. The kitchen really dropped the ball on a Sunday night. Our food took over 45 minutes to make it to the table. And then they couldn't even get a burger well done. It's not that hard. Completely dissatisfied and won't be coming again. No comps, or even explanations from the kitchen staff or management.",2
1855,Weak steamed clams. The waiter was great and the view was wonderful so go for that the bisque was way to much on the tomato side than he lobster,3
1856,"We chose the hotel for our room block for our wedding on May 11, 2014, as we have stayed here several times over the years, and we thought that it would be a special experience for our guests. We were EXTREMELY disappointed. We arrived and checked in and were given the smallest room I have ever seen. It barely fit my husband and I, never mind a bride who planned to get ready in the room with hair/makeup artists, photographer, videographer. I was shocked that they would put a bride and groom in such a terrible room, and was bummed to see that my family members also had the same tiny rooms. I begged everyone in the staff I could contact for an upgrade, but was told the hotel was booked with other wedding parties. We had this room block in place for 8 months at this point, and I would think a bride who is bringing the hotel 25 room bookings would get preferred accommodations. I wasted a ridiculous amount of time over the next few days talking to the front desk and group sales to try to get another room. We were finally moved into a room that was a little more spacious on Saturday, May 10th, but it was still far from adequate to accommodate a bridal party. We were uncomfortably crammed into a very small room the day of the wedding and I was beyond disappointed. 
I had also arranged for our second-line after our wedding to end back at the hotel, and months before the wedding I had left repeated messages and emails for the person in charge to discuss this. He never called me back, and I was finally connected to him by group sales who had arranged the room block. I was told that we would have a designated area for our guests when we arrived after the wedding. I brought 70 people to the bar, and there was no place designated for our group. We were all scattered around the bar, as if I had never put the effort in to arrange anything beforehand.  
Lastly, upon checking in my sister (and MOH) waited at the carosel bat for her room to be ready and checked her luggage in the luggage room. When the it was finally ready, a bellcap brought up her bags. Her garment bag, which contained thousands of dollars worth of clothing (including her MOH dress) was not brought up with the rest of her bags. When she realized this later that evening, she immediately contacted the front desk and the baggage room, and her garment bag was not there. We spent the entire weekend hunting for the lost bag, with little help from management. We were sent from person to person, with no apologies, and were never able to view the security tapes which may have helped us track it down. Clearly, it was either given to the wrong hotel guest or stolen. The hotel claimed zero liability and was NO help in retrieving her belongings. Rather than enjoying time with our wedding guests that had flown in in from all over the country, we spent the day before the wedding running around the French Quarter to find (and spend more money) on a new Maid of Honor dress. There was no assistance from the staff, no compensation for the missing bag, or even sympathy. The entire situation was unacceptable. After spending thousands of dollars and bringing so much business to your hotel, we left feeling like our stay here ruined our wedding weekend. I have contacted management to discuss our stay several times over a span of months and my calls/email were not retured. If I had to do it all over again I would never have brought my guests to a place with such a lack of customer service or concern.",1
1857,"Had a great four-day stay here, obviously.  

The Hollander may not be Hilton-perfect (there is one of those several blocks away), but it's beyond quaint - it works well.  Most importantly, it's not expensive. And it's a beautifully remodeled historic building with gorgeous hardwood floors, polished to perfection. In addition to the nicely appointed rooms, the stairwells are comfortably furnished, floored with the same gorgeous hardwood.  Which I might not have known if they did not have a slow cozy elevator.  The fun lobby hosts all sorts of entertainment from singing to trivia nights - not only free, but winners might earn some Hollander bucks. The staff, from the desk to the maids, are personable and competent. If you don't want to stroll the few blocks downtown, The Hollander offers a open-air shuttle cart to the downtown area or any nearby destination, such as Tropicana Field (and yes, also free).

On Tuesday nights, the Tap Room there will pour a large frosty mug of any one of their many craft beers for only $3. And the next night you may choose a craft beer and gourmet burger for just $10. Speaking of $10, they have a chef-hosted Sunday brunch for that price, too. Beyond burgers, they have a variety of entrees, including a tasty vegetarian eggplant stack. 

The only negatives I can come up with are, at least while I was there, the techno-crap lobby music they played early in the evening (before the real entertainment started) was not only horrible, some of few lyrics one could hear might've been offensive to families - it was just strange and at odds with the classy BnB feel of the place.  Also, the wifi didn't work well for me, but that might've been my laptop.  Like elevators, if you're looking for luxury showers pouring out waterfalls of perfectly temp-controlled water, this might not be the place for you.  Being an older place, no central air, and that's needed in July, so the in-room units run all the time - not ideal, but they worked well and didn't bother me too much.  One lamp and a cold CFL bulb, the other a warm incandescent which I liked (not sure what to make of that mix;-).  Also, they appear to be dog friendly, as there were a few very well-behaved and nice-looking dogs in the lobby.  Even though I didn't have a dog, I liked that, but perhaps someone else wouldn't.  Oh, and there were folks smoking outside - not much one can do about that here in Florida, but fortunately they have a nice large patio area and was enough enough to find some clean breathing space.

Wow, I wrote many negatives, but still feels like a 5 to me.",5
1858,"We had high expectations for Mr. B's Bistro based on the reviews posted. The food was tasty, it was also served cold: two out of 4 appetizers (both were soups) were sent back because of the temperature and three of four mains were sent back for the same reason.  The wait staff was excellent and corrected the issues quickly and professionally so the issues did not ""ruin"" our evening. Despite the temperature issues, the food was very good, service excellent and atmosphere was average.  In my opinion Mr. B's Bistro earns a 3 out of 5 rating because the overall experience fell short of the expectations of a pricey Bistro.",3
1859,"Worst orange leaf. Haven't been to this one in years but decided to give it a shot. Same. Not flavorful froyo, almost too cold to taste anything.",1
1860,"They take advantage of people who doesn't speak English and sign them up for a membership. They have ridiculous rules about cancelling membership but luckily for my father, he was from CA. I sent them a message via their website in December saying I have a copy of his license and I'd like to e-mail them to prove that he's not from the area and have his membership cancelled. No one bothered to reply back with an e-mail address nor physical mailing address since January was around the corner and they can rob my father of that extra month of membership fee. No wonder these thieves aren't successful as the two major gym we have nationwide. Sooner they get that through their thick skull and start having some decent customer service, sooner they'd be successful. Terrible experience. Don't use this place. You'll definitely get robbed.",1
1861,"I should have read the reviews before going here. I pass ""Tony Luke's"" on the regular SAT mornings around 12:30. So I decided to Stop in for the first time ready to have a delicious war in my mouth from a nice philly cheese steak. NOT!!!!!!",1
1862,"Best breakfast I've had in a long long time. We waited over an hour and I would do it again in a heartbeat. The grill medley was fantastic. I asked for sweet potato pancakes instead of buttermilk and it was not a problem. The syrup that comes with the sweet potato pancakes was a little heavy on the cinnamon, but try it with the regular syrup and you won't regret it! So good. The wife had the chocolate sin and she liked it but said she'd prefer the sweet potato pancakes. A must visit in Nashville.",5
1863,"Had a massage there. Got an appointment immediately and there is the advantage of being open late on weekdays. 

Massage was good, I will not say it was best, but it was good. Might go there again if I really really need it and have no other choice.

Had the massage in a private room. they do try to sell memberships everytime you go and am not sure how good those memberships are.",3
1864,"We stayed at the hotel for one week...when we went in we were looking for the frig to put some things in.  it was missing one item and we didn't touch any of the items due to the high price...we purchased our own.  We only had maid service once, we wanted to prevent any theft.  when we were leaving we checked the frig and there were 3 more item missing.  I was charged $42.90 for drinks and things were didn't use.
The room was clean but not enough lighting.  It didn't have a coffee maker in the room but down in the lobby you could get coffee for free.  the bathroom need towel racks, it didn't have any.  
I was disappointed that I was charged because someone came in the room and drank the booze!!!!!!
We also only got one wash rag to wash with and hardly any towels.  I wouldn't stay here again....because I was charged for nothing.
Also, the TV in the elevator was on all the time, annoying.",3
1865,"Cramped feeling, but very friendly staff! 

We know that WF is always a great place to grab a healthy snack or drink (today it was just a GIANT bottle of 365 Brand Bottled water for 69 cents!) when we're traveling, and this visit was no exception.",4
1866,"They hire security inside that don't even work. They just hit on girls and this one staff was trying to hit on my date and dance with her while in his Tonic uniform. How pathetic and no manager even cares to do anything. 
I usually get in just fine though because I wear tight jeans as I have read the other reviews and about Latinos and African Americans being discriminated against. I have seen it with my own eyes. 
Well, if they want to lose money keep on acting like this Tonic used to be packed now it's empty most of the time.",1
1867,"This is seriously one of the best farmer's markets I've been to between (and including) San Francisco and San Diego. You can get almost anything here - from painted gourds to shrimps to organic lavender bunches to sweet cherries. Add in a backdrop of perfect weather and background music from a sitar player and a high school minstrel troupe and you'll start to get an idea of what's what here. All this and mas at totally reasonable prices too. I recommend trying out a cherimoya if you've never had one - it's a real treat!

For more info on the weekly schedule, check out the website - the one on Saturday is on the corner of Santa Barbara and Cota Streets and it goes from 8:30 to 12:30. Even though it's pretty bustling, parking wasn't a problem.",5
1868,"I bought the Groupon massage as well.  When I called, they said they were booked out to the second week of October and my Groupon expires Oct. 2nd.  Not impressed at all.  It sounds like the massage isn't worth it anyways from the review here.",1
1869,"Was in Indy for work back in July. The pizza here is really the best you will find in the area. Lunch buffet is good. I'm a vegetarian so naturally selection can be limited. 2 days in a row with 2 different employees, they made a fresh vegetarian friendly pizza. Both pizzas were very good, and with the plain pizza, salad and pasta in the buffet, lunch was great. The people working here were very friendly in a genuine way. Not fake McYouknowwho friendly.  I am a harsh critic when it comes to pizza and this pizza was very good, not Sao Paulo good, but enough that Lucas is on my stop list next time im in IN for work.",5
1870,This is going to be my forever nail spot! Lana always does an amazing job. She is very picky about how my nails look and I love that!,5
1871,"Normally this is my favorite place in town for a nice dinner. They still are a great place to go for brunch,drinks,apps, or sandwich/burger. However, recently they have really downgraded the quality of their steak and salmon (atleast what they put on their salads) and it is very disappointing. I was hoping it was just one bad batch but it has happened on more than 1 occasion recently and I have friends that have noticed the same decline in quality. Don't get greedy depot! Everybody loves it here so just keep buying the quality ingredients you always have : )",3
1872,"Yes it is lunch time so expected to be busy. We were told a 70 minute wait for 2ppl. We opted to order out and take to hotel figuring it would be faster. It is now over 30 minutes and still waiting. I guess we could have waiting for a table.

I'm sure the food is great but will have to update that later.",2
1873,Excellent mushoom ravioli.  The spinach pie was fantastic. Possibly the best baklava I've ever had.,5
1874,"I can grant them that this is the busiest time of the year. Not my choice to move at this time, work directed. - but their consumer service takes piss poor to a new level. Instead of providing name of driver and #, all I get is he will arrive between 8-10 in the morning. Awesome! Quite possibly one of the hottest days of the year here (StL) and they may or may not start loading the truck until 10? Okey dokie. 

And the delivery window is five to eleven days. All of their paper work states I asked for early delivery. I did NOT! Then the kid on the phone says easy enough to drive 2200 miles by Monday. Truck may or may not leave on Wednesday or Thursday. How dare you tell me how far I can or will drive.",1
1875,"Food was fresh & tasted great! Prices are reasonable too -- I ordered steamed dumplings, shrimp lo mein, chicken w hot garlic sauce, lake tung ting shrimp, pork fried rice & Chinese donuts -- all for $40! They threw in a free order of general tso, I'm usually hesitant with free food, but that too tasted fresh! Chicken w hot garlic sauce wasn't spicy at all though neither was general tso. So if u like spicy, u may want to tell them to kick it up. Chinese donuts are yummy! They don't have BBQ spare ribs, which was a bummer. But u can order online, which I love!!! Will be my go to chinese delivery since I'm new to the area.",4
1876,"Had a great experience with them on multiple occasions and have spent hundreds there over the last year.  I had an even coming up and wanted to have my hair styled with flat iron curls which takes no more than 20 mins to do my hair.  I called and was told that everyone was booked up, and there was no way they could fit me in.  I even said I would come anytime that worked for them, and they were unwilling to fit me in even for such a quick appointment.  Sorry, but they lost a frequent customer, just because they couldn't be flexible.",2
1877,"I absolutely love this place! Food is very good.... beer is cold and a great variety. Facility is clean. Service is extremely inconsistent.  I have been to this location several times and each time it is like going to a different restaurant.  For the first time we had a great server Rachel!  Although the service was slow she was great.   Again out order was wrong,  but she actually caught it before we could say anything.   She apologized and coolrrected it immediately.  Not sure if the problem is corporate or local management but someone needs to address the inconsistency in everything from service to portion size to timing.  Overall if you have time it is worth the wait, but don't go starving or you may not make it before you are initially served.  12 minutes from sitting to getting my beer.",3
1878,The food was good. I had the 2 meat dinner with ribs and brisket with Mac and cheese and waffle fries. The flavor of the barbecue was good but it could have been warmer. The Mac and cheese and fries were very tasty. The warm barbecue sauce bar was a nice addition as well to the free soft serve ice cream. It was also pricy for the portion. Overall pretty good.,3
1879,Ordered a smoked chicken quesadilla last night and there was a long hair in it that was threaded through the chicken. Super disgusting! Last time I was here there was still wax paper in the beef brisket. This kitchen needs to get it together with their quality control!,2
1880,"A few years ago my parents, my brothers and i went to this restaraunt for my birthday. We ordered the usual huge spread because we love thai food. But there was a surprise in the tea. A roach, swimming around. The server brought a new pot (no apology) and that was all. No taking the tea off the bill, no acknowledgement of what happened, nothing. We haven't eaten there since.",1
1881,Everything touristy can be bought here. Claustrophobia city though. Tight quarters. The register lady was very nice and cheery. Good place to get souvenirs.,2
1882,"This gym has everything from cardio, weights, ropes and a turf for agility exercises. The trainers are really nice and do a good job of motivating you. I have a few classes with Rich and Dan that are really good. Parking is relatively easy since it is located in the city. I've never had that much problem for parking, never had to park more than 2 blocks away. I really like this gym a lot.

Regarding the billing complaints on other reviews, I bought a year membership and prepaid for a cheaper deal. I haven't had any additional charges, but am not sure if the billing process might be different if I was month to month.",5
1883,"Very disappointed overall. The service was average. The setting seemed no different than that of a regular restaurant. The food.... That's the most disappointing part. 
My boyfriend and I love Mexican food. So we went here on valentines day. How can a restaurant claim to be Mexican food when there is no fried ice cream on the menu?! This should have been my first clue. Next clue should have been that the names of the food were in English with some having a Spanish translation underneath. 
The food was terrible. Nothing tasted good. 
This was just a restaurant trying to hard to be something it's not. It should be called On the Border: Americas attempt at making less than average non authentic Mexican food.",2
1884,"I can honestly say the class I took at Session Yoga was the WORST class I have taken in my 30 years of Yoga practice. There was absolutely no mention of Breath, of quieting the mind, of connection of body, mind, spirit. It was full on rigorous, physical repetitions accompanied by terrible loud pop music.There was no adjustments or corrections and as I looked around the room I noticed most of the students doing the poses incorrectly. Very damaging to the joints and body. Yikes!
 Apart from this it was 98 degrees inside and very stinky. I was saddened that this class was named YOGA. As yoga to me is SACRED. Call it BOOTCAMP, or CALISTHENICS. but not YOGA please. It certainly was not worth $8 dollars!",1
1885,"Service was horrible.  Ask the waiter for extra butter for the baked potato and by the time the butter came the potato was so cold, even the half melted butter wouldn't even melt the rest of the way. Took ten minutes to flag down our server for more soda since he never came back to check on us. Husband got the short ribs which was three pieces of meat. Ate one and started to eat the next but the remaining pieces were just fat and gristle. Complained to the server and was told the dinner would be taken off our bill but we had to pay for the sides. So how exactly did the ""sides"" almost cost as much as the dinner???? they took off $1.99. Bitched and they took off another 10%. Still NOT WORTH IT!!!. And all they said was sorry but it's our policy. Yes go ahead and laugh..... we are Seniors and eat in a lot of diners.  Never experienced anything like this before.",1
1886,"Ahh the simplicity. ReAnimator has a plentiful, diverse coffee/cream supply for all your pick me up needs. Get real work done here and fade far far away from the soul reaping city. I recommend mid day. Get a cozy outdoor seat. WiFi. Coffee subscription.",4
1887,"Schlafly Bottleworks is one of my favorite places to go to in St. Louis.  For being a craft brewery, their food is also very good and you can tell they take great pride in it.  The atmosphere is very causal, but classy.  The facility is very large so there is a lot of room.  They have an outdoor covered patio which is very cool.  They also have live music several nights during the week.  Their beer has been a staple in St. Louis for over 20 years.  I would recommend Schlafly to anyone who is a craft beer fan.",4
1888,"Was here for a conference.  During the conference time, there was a Monday night football game.  Lots of different people with lots of different needs.  The staff dealt with it beautifully.  The manager, Angel, is just that.  She helped me with a reservation problem and was beyond phenomenal.  The staff is super friendly and very helpful.

Aloft, in general, tries some funky décor - and the king room is set up a little odd.  Warning for your shins, the king bed sits on a platform that is not flush with the mattress. Owie! However, it works.  The bed, aside from my shins, was comfy - plenty of pillows.  Also, the large windows have great blackout screens for sleeping.  

As far as noise, the hotel at the end of a private jet runway at the airport.  That noise is not so bad.  But for the Monday night game, there was a lot of traffic.  On the weekend, there were some munchkins running up and down the hall, but the staff took care of them.  There was a contract that weekend guests had to sign for parties.

Ubers are not so bad downtown and it is close to the sports stadiums.  It's nice having a shuttle right to the airport.

I enjoyed the stay.  It was a good hotel.",4
1889,"I would give this company more stars if I could. I knew my youngest daughter had lice because her best friend had it and I saw nits (eggs) in her hair. My friend gave me this company's name so I called and spoke to Emily. She promptly made me her next appointment. 
In comes Caroline and she was amazing. Very thorough while schooling me on everything she knew about lice, how to get rid of and how to prevent for the future. My youngest daughter was moderately infested and she worked so patiently getting out all of the lice.  She checked my entire family.
I highly recommend this company. Don't stress yourself out by using harmful pesticides. This company will do all the work for you and tell you step by step instructions how to clean the home after an infestation.",5
1890,"First, to get the bad out of the way.  NO RESERVATIONS!  This disturbing trend by some new restaurants: ""We really don't give a **** if we inconvenience YOU, we just don't want to mess with reservations.."" is particularly an issue at The Livery, as even at 5:30 the bar was already pretty much full.  So you can try to squeeze in around the bar, where the servers are looking annoyed because you're in their way (you are), or you can sit on a bench in the foyer not knowing if you'll get a table in 30 minutes or 4 hours.  Totally unacceptable in my book.

Now the good:   The food is awesome!  As is typical of the Cunningham group restaurants, the menu is well thought out with Latin American themed small plates and entrees.  We tried quite a few and they were all tasty with an interesting amalgamation of flavors and seasonings.  Service was good, with the servers well trained on the menu options.

So overall, a good experience, especially since we didn't have to wait too long, but I wouldn't try it on a weekend after 6 pm or so, unless your time is so unworthy that you want to sit around indefinitely for a table.",3
1891,Melissa is by far the BEST! I've gone to two other lash lounges and I will tell you Melissa outdoes them all. She knows her craft. She doesn't double or triple stack lashes. She gets you in and out. 100% recommend going to Melissa.,5
1892,My wife and I had a great time on this tour. We both love history and this walking tour enables you to learn some great stories about the founding and city of Philadelphia. Our tour guide was animated and on top of his game! I would highly recommend this walking tour!,5
1893,"I had my second disappointing experience at the Richel D'Ambra Spa yesterday.   Be Aware that this spa is not run by Ritz Carlton like some other spas within the Ritz Carlton facilities and it is well below Ritz quality and standards.  Considering how seriously the Ritz Carlton takes customer service it is shocking to me that they have this spa in their facilities.  

I had to call them twice just to book and confirm the appointment because I was put on hold for more than 15 min and kept calling back to make sure the appt was confirmed.  I got the same gentleman on the phone again and he acted like we never talked even though it was 10 min prior.  When I showed up for my massage the next day the woman said she did not show an appointment for me. . . no attempt to accommodate me in any way. I was really surprised at how little the staff cared about the error. I also had a previous bad experience with this spa with charges to my card that was difficult to clear up.

Some of the other spas in Philly that I go to frequently that I have always had a 100% fantastic experience are Four Seasons spa, Omni hotel spa and Terme Di Aroma spa. There are MUCH BETTER Spa choices in Philly than Richel D'Ambra.",1
1894,Good food and boba especially the taro . service is straight to the point. It is a small place very much a deli,4
1895,"While the food and service are excellent (loved the chicken pad thai, mango rice + a very friendly & humorous waitress), the parking & location was a total nightmare. The restaurant is often overcrowded (the size of the restaurant is small) and waits can be an issue. Also, they leave the front door open, which allows cold air to fill the restaurant. Basically, once inside, it's easy to feel claustrophobic and chilly. 

Overall, the location isn't good at all. I'm sure college students love it close to their respective campuses, but it has a negative effect on the restaurant's ambiance and culture. 

However, the experience (once inside) is appreciable. A four-star rating if not for sub-par external criteria.",2
1896,"This place was amazing when I had the money to go here on a weekly basis.  I wish I could still afford to go here weekly, as they've got  the best sushi I've ever had.",5
1897,"I LOVE this place!! The environment is very urban and homey, and since you can see what's cooking (literally) in front of you, you know you're getting the freshest of coffee! And they roast their beans IN HOUSE. So in short, It's a great place with great coffee. Only downfall is that coffee is pricey but that's the price you pay for the whole ""shebang"" I guess.",5
1898,"Never thought I could sit down at a place like this do work and homework and enjoy a coffee. But this place is amazing. Great to do business and school assignments and enjoy it. Service is great, always seems like they are in a great mood. Still haven't tried the salads but have had every sandwich and they are delicious.",5
1899,"This is the best classic Italian pizza in central Bucks County.
Crust is thin and fresh.  Dough is made here.  This means that it is more tender, develops a better crunch and smells  like fresh bread.
There is no other way to make a really good pizza.
Toppings are varied and plentiful.  Also meat balls are very good tender and flavorful, rolls are fresh;  sauce is for real.  
Paninnis are well made and grilled just right.
Slices or whole pies are available.  Honest teas,  Boylan sodas and fountain drinks are for sale as well.
We go out of the way for this pizza.  It is worth it.",5
1900,"The second time came to this BBQ place. Overall, it's better than most of other BBQ places in the city but not the best. 

The presentation was impressive and amazing. Everyone got surprised by the portion of their food. The brisket was tender but didn't have too much flavour. The potato in the salad was not cooked enough and still very hard and raw. The yam fries was the highlight of the dinner. The sloppy Hogg burger was too big to have everything with one bite. Even the burger lover had to either cut it into half or dissemble it. The pork meat was thick cut but dry and flavourless. The pineapple was also thick cut and grilled. But still raw inside and tasted sour. 

It is a generous restaurant. That's it!",3
1901,"Had dinner here one even and the food was awesome.  OK, the beer was awesome which probably enhanced my food experience.   My coworker was sober and said it was good so I'll take her word for it.  Great neighborhood joint and would definitely be back.",4
1902,Yay!!! I love this place! There are so many more delicious options than any coffee place in town! The staff is easy going and put a special touch on everything.,5
1903,The pizza was great. My new favorite. A great addition to the flavor of South Grand. The owner truly cares about the quality of his product. I would recommend natty's to anyone. Truly a South Grand destination.,5
1904,"When I walked in here I did so with every intention of reviewing it. And in my mind I said, ""I've been here a few times and I'm pretty certain a 2-star is the best they'll ever get out of me.""

Obviously this visit dissuaded me and gained themselves an extra star.

That said, while the employees are extremely (almost overly) friendly, the store still looks...cheap. Compared to Border's or Barnes and Noble I feel like this is the equivalent of having a taco from Taco Bell rather than Taco Bus (if you don't know what the means, go Yelp! for Taco Bus). 

My point is this: It's good/okay/satisfies-the-""craving"", but when it comes down to it there are other, better, places that are just around the corner.",3
1905,"live five minutes from this place. I like the concept and the unique drink options- the ginger-beet pink lemonade is awesome; big fan. but the burgers are average at best and over priced. The meat it's self I found was dry. given they're going for the whole health conscious scene, there probably using 90:10 burgers which is why they're dry as hell. The Jalapeño ranch here is amazing. but for the amount you spend, me and my buddy who is half my size walked out of there still hungry. so in the end it comes down to average food, good drinks, but leaving unsatisfied",2
1906,"This place is historically significant, and the staff is very informative. This is where the 1st Continental Congress met as far back as 1724!",5
1907,"This place takes hipster to whole new level.  It's just too over the top in terms of breakfast offerings (they don't honor any food exceptions and they don't even offer a standard eggs and bacon option).  Everything is overly complicated, and takes about 3 looks to actually understand the menu.  I ordered the tofu salad, which was just blah.  My friend ordered the chocolate waffle - he said it was very chocolatey, but didn't have much else to say.  The service was slow and inattentive, even though the place was only a quarter full.  While I appreciate the great environment and decor, this place is just too over the top for me.",2
1908,"Went there the other night and the service was horrible. Girl behind counter yawned in my face than said ""what you want?"" Seriously? That's how you ask to take my order? Wow.. Trying not to judge the entire experience on terrible service, we tried our sundaes and were even less impressed. Our turtle sundae didn't have any caramel in it - you know -one of the main ingredients, my Christy had the worst iced brownie in it if ever tasted - total bargain basement, still frozen, so bad even a little Debbie brownie would have been a massive upgrade & the Smore was a pretty light on toppings, pretty sad excuse... Not going to waste my money here again, that's for sure! Will spend my money @ How Sweet Is This & Fritz's for now on, where I actually get what I pay for and more...",1
1909,"I came in for maintenance at the 5000 mileage mark on a Saturday at noon. They estimated it would take an hour and a half. It took half an hour. Bravo! 

Leasing my car from this dealership was quick and painless, too. They didn't try to oversell me and rip me off the way dealerships did in LA. Highly recommend getting a car here.",5
1910,"The place is small, inviting, and clean. However, the service may be a bit forgetful. On two occasions, my dining companion ordered soda and we didn't receive until we were halfway done with our dosas after much prompting.

Otherwise, they offer great dosas (e.g. rava, mysore masala, etc.). You're not coming here for the ambiance. You come here for the dosas. Haven't tried their chaats yet. Plastic utensils. Simple and basic.

Don't really feel like driving all the way out there though :-/",3
1911,"We bought a Groupon before checking reviews for this place.  Big mistake!  But we went there anyway last week.  My wife had a small pizza which she said was okay.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which was the driest thing I've ever eaten.   Service was very slow...we asked for parmesan cheese with my wife's pizza and never saw our waitress again!  Finally we went into the kitchen to get our check.
Nope, not again...",1
1912,"My first bad experience involved an order of lettuce wraps.  The lettuce was soft, dry, rubbery, and nasty.  Oh well.  My next crappy visit involved getting ripped off on a drink special.  When I pointed out the error, the manager/bartender Gabe refused to correct it and asked ""Is it really worth arguing about?"".  Nope, won't be back.",1
1913,"No complaints about this place! My group ordered pork/shrimp & shrimp spring rolls, beef ""tacos"" (which are really steamed buns), a banh mi, and chicken bun. My favorites were the beef steamed bun and banh mi! The bread was perfect. The service was fast and efficient. I definitely suggest giving this place a try!!!",4
1914,"Stayed in the Santa Barbara Casita. It's perfect. The only BAD THING is that we check out in 1 hour . 

We parked our car and haven't gotten back into it. Everything is walking distance. From state street to the peer and everything between. We had late lunch in downtown and walked to beach for sunset, although the sun sets behind the mountains, the changing colors in sky are beautiful. 
Breakfast was YUMMM  and everything was perfect. The Santa Barbara casita was clean, charming, spacious and the bed super comfy. Private entrances and we haven't seen another guest. Lil parking lot is full so we know there's others here. 

We will be back for sure. We stayed Thursday- Friday. Quick lil getaway but well worth it. 

Thank you Eagle Inn.",5
1915,"I'm only giving 3 stars cuz of the drinks "" top shelf margaritas ""   Were mediocre. I drink lots of margaritas, ok. If ya gonna do Mexican ya need a great margarita.   And the waiter did not know anything. The bar staff seamed lost. 

      I got the red fish fajitas,, it was delicious. the wife got a stake taco , it was stuffed with meat and also delicious. 
 
     For me it's "" I ate there  once and won't go back"".",3
1916,"I love Skyline Chili.  I first had this stuff in Cincinnati, and I was thrilled to when a location opened in Clearwater. 

This particular Skyline, however, is not great.  The service is generally poor, and the food comes out very slowly.   It seems like every time that I go, they are ""out"" of something, or some equipment isn't working.  Sometimes it's baked potatoes, sometimes it is french fries, sometimes it is something else.

Love the cheese coney hot dogs all the way!

I hope this location can get their act together.",2
1917,"Nice neighborhood bar. Very friendly atmosphere. Definitely laid back and not fancy at all. When we came recently, we sat out on the back patio which was nice. They even turned on the heaters for us. This is more of a bar than a restaurant, but the food is still good. The front bar is smoking, btw. Typical menu of things you would find at a pub. Our waitress was great and very attentive. I had a cheeseburger which was really good and huge. Their sandwiches are also good. The food prices are reasonable, and I think the beers are too. However, the mixed drinks are pretty pricey. My simple cranberry & vodka was 7 or 8 dollars. Overall, i'm sure we will be back",4
1918,"Came here for a late lunch on a weekday. The place looks great, I love the decor and the general theme that they are going for. My service was something left to be desired. I wish the staff would have let me know the theme of the food or that it was a bit different than what most people may be used to. I love to try new things, just want to know all about it first. The drinks and chips made up for the food just being so-so bland. 

For trying to be a newer place, they literally need to season/spice it up! Be excited about your place and what it has to offer. Get some awesome flavors to jump at me!

Faves: they do make some good in house tortilla chips",2
1919,"Just ate a burger from there about 15 minutes ago. Had the 500 burger, ordered it medium. Got home and was about to take a bite and I look at the patty and the thing is pretty much raw. Now I can understand it being a bit undercooked but this thing was no where near medium. Very disappointing. Had to cook it up and dirty a pan at home. Didn't taste any seasonings. 
Had the truffle fries as well. While the flavor was great but there was nothing but beat up fries in my bag. boooooo.
I'll prob go back and give them one more shot but the first impression is not very good.",2
1920,their spicy fried rice is amazing and pretty much anything else is good too. wish they were open on Sundays for lunch.,5
1921,Food and drinks were really good! Service wasn't! At one point we couldn't find our server. But the live music was really good! If our server wasn't MIA we would have stayed the whole night!,4
1922,"Tucked in the back of a small shopping plaza on Bay to Bay Blvd. 

I like this place because it is easy to get an appointment. I was able to call and make an appointment for the same day even though I'd never been there before. The introductory price was $49, I believe it goes up to $69 after that. 

The inside is very nice with many small rooms that are clean and calming. After completing  a lengthy questionnaire including questions about what type of pressure I like all the way to what type of music I would like on during my massage. After about 5 minutes of paperwork, I was taken back to a small room. The room I was in was actually the couple's massage room so it was separated from another (empty)massage table by a sheer curtain. The therapist was very friendly and concerned for my comfort. I prefer a more silent massage experience and there was a little too much talking for my liking. She did do a great job working out my knots and lactic acid build up. 

Overall, it was a decent massage. Good place for a last minute visit. I would return to try another therapist for sure.",3
1923,"I tried to book reservations through yelp, they confirmed my reservations, i called the night before just to confirm my reservations was still there, i was hung up three different times, spoke to a manager just to find out they do not see my reservations and they was having problems with yelp. This ruin my plans. Call this restaurant if you want make reservations",1
1924,"The Cake Bake Shop a picturesque cake bakery.  You can get desserts (cakes) by the slice or a whole cake.  The store is tucked away in a neighborhood in Broad Ripple - off a side street, but still close to the action.  It has parking.

Once you go inside, it is pretty magical.  It is like you are being transported to another time in far away France.  The lights are bright, the desserts look amazing, the music is soothing, the atmosphere makes you just want to relax, drink a cup of coffee or tea and enjoy the cake.

Unfortunately, that is where it stops.  I have been here a few times.  My first visit was magical and rejuvenating.  Since then, it has changed.  I keep giving it one more chance hoping that magic will return.  But... it does not.  Overall my thoughts:

- the staff seems to be in a big hurry to get you served and move on to the next.  If you have a question about anything, it may be better just not to ask.  They seem like I am just interrupting something more important they have to do.  It is most unfortunate.  If the staff were friendly and could act as though they cared about the patrons, this place would be better.  

- the cakes are beautiful, but they have lost the moistness they use to have.  It makes me wonder if they are making them and keeping them refrigerated now where they use to be fresh.  (Refrigerating a cake will dry it out, and that is what it seems to me.)",3
1925,"The place looked interesting enough, the live music was pleasant enough, the food and drink were over priced and marginal at best, but the coupe de grace was delivered when I received the check. I had asked for an additional portion of herbed mayonaise that accompanied my Cuban sandwich, upon examination of the check, I found a $1 charge for a table spoon of mayo. Unbeliebvable. I said something to the manager who did nothing but say ""that's how it is.""
Don't be lured by the interesting exterior......this place is not worth your time or money and the management is completely tone deaf on customer perception of value; $8 for a 10oz glass of common IPA, $18 for lack luster fish tacos plus mayo for $1. There are much better options in that town or accross the river.",1
1926,"First off-This hotel has clearly improved a great deal since some of the previous reviews!  However, the two stars are really only reflective of some of the major 'cons' that I've noted, below- there were many pros as well.  

Pros: Nice room, free broadband (though service could be spotty), decor in hotel made you feel relaxed, nice pool & hot tub (though often crowded out by screaming children- though what else is new there?), and most of all- very friendly staff! 

Cons: Here are the major cons that got this hotel only two stars: They should disclose to clients upon booking that there is a restaurant on the first level that PLAYS LOUD MUSIC PAST 10PM AND SMOKES BARBECUE ON ITS PATIO, THE SMELL OF WHICH *WILL* OVERWHELM YOUR ROOM...if you stay anywhere above said restaurant (the 'Opry Backstage Grill' ... based on older reviews, this seems to have been an Applebee's in a former life!) ... basically, the hotel should ask guests upon booking or checking in if they don't mind these two very important details, because, um, you kind of have to not care in order to have an even remotely pleasurable experience if you happen to be placed above this restaurant.  

And so, if you're priced out of the nearby Gaylord Opry Resort or just need to stay in the area for any other reason & are an early-to-bed type who also doesn't want the smell of smoked barbecue EVERYWHERE in your room, just make sure you ask to be placed somewhere away from the restaurant!",2
1927,"The cro-cremes are amazing and addictive. I haven't tried much else from the bakery, but that alone is worth returning for.",5
1928,"Bad service, okay food. Bar was slow and they were out of many wines/beers and no clean wine glasses?? This was a Wednesday!  Limited menu. Only one salad on the menu and it was a Ceasar - horrible!
I will not go back...",1
1929,"Absolutely terrible, ordered tickets that was to include dinner. We were there for 2 hours and never received our dinner, but they made sure we fulfilled the two drink minimum. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Show mediocre at best.",1
1930,I don't get all the good reviews!?? Everything was way over priced. Waiters snobby. Atmosphere....not casual. Everyone was dressy. The gumbo I got was meh. Shrimp and grits was ok. Nothing great though. Oh and the only refill we got was our water. Coke is in a bottle so I guess I should've expected no refills but on tea? Wasted $80. There are way better places to eat.,1
1931,"Excellent happy hour. Half off pizza and dollar off beers and cocktails from 4-8. Service was very good and so friendly. 90% of food is made in.horse, rest is locally sourced. And you can tell.

Me and my friend sat at the bar for 3 hours. Music was great too. I will be returning!",4
1932,"It's a diner. If you want escargot bourguignons or pate fois gras, you're in the wrong joint. You want fried eggs, breakfast meats, and a mountain of hashbrowns, all covered in sausage gravy served hot at an odd hour of the night, then this is the place.",4
1933,"I was here a few times because my friends won free happy hours. When I won one, I sent in my guest list and tried to call them a few times to confirm. Neither of the people who answered the phone were friendly or helpful, and I never did get in touch with the woman in charge of happy hours. She never returned my emails or phone calls. When I showed up with my friends, they didn't have my name on the list and forgot that they even offered me a happy hour. It was irritating, and after some fighting, they eventually let me through.

There is a dress code (no sneakers, flip flops, hats, etc.), but I don't really mind. The bouncers and bartenders aren't very friendly and can be slow, and I never tried the food. The crowd isn't great either - attractive and douchey (maybe because, like us, they're just trying to get drunk and go somewhere else). 

Free booze is always good, but I wouldn't come here for any other reason.",2
1934,"Opening night! I love the rich, dark decor of the interior. Gives a great French bistro feel to the place. Staff was fantastic, very attentive. 

We had the calamari, which was surprisingly different than the norm. It was sweet and spicy! Pork lollipops were, well just redic! Great glaze and the portions were HUGE bites. Fried rice was very savory, we added pork belly to the fantastic Vietnamese sausage in it. 

Then the ramen... there are no words, but I will try! Pork belly cooked to perfection, crispy edges yet tender on the inside. Charred garlic, the ever perfect Sun noodles. Broth was rich and flavorful. Only drawback was the egg as it was over cooked, but that will be remedied soon enough I am sure. 

Going back next week, cannot wait, like Christmas in June.",5
1935,"This was a great hotel.  I loved that (despite being a city hotel) it had a swimming pool and hot tub.  Decent work out center.  Nice, comfortable, quiet rooms.  Everything you could ask for.  Plus, doubletree gives you free cookies when you check in!  Sooo gooood....",4
1936,"I've visited this café once and will certainly be giving it a second try! My first experience was all positive. I came on crutches and the staff were super accommodating. They brought me what I ordered so I could sit down and held the door for me when I left. Upon arriving, I was delighted to find a clean café with a wide range of menu options that work for special dietary needs for a place that doesn't label themselves as strictly vegan, gluten free, etc. They had both soy and almond milk, vegan soft serve, and several other menu options that were vegan and/or gluten free. They also had a good menu in the way of coffee and other drinks and some nicer options for sandwiches, salads, and the like. I ordered a café au lait with almond milk and a plain bagel with Earth Balance. The au lait was tasty and not too pricey even with the almond milk. The bagel order came out a little bit differently than what I had ordered- I got an everything bagel with cream cheese. I'm not usually one to speak up about that kind of thing, having been on the other end of things at the café where I work, and my shyness coupled with all of the friendliness I had already experienced from the staff led me to let it go. To my surprise, though, the staff took notice themselves. Upon realizing, the girl who had taken my order was extremely apologetic and corrected the mistake right away! I felt generally very welcomed at Benna's West and will be returning soon (with my dog! Bonus points to Benna's for allowing friendly canines into their coffee shops).",4
1937,"This is the biggest and best location for HMV in the city. The prices aren't any different from other stores but they do have a larger selection of gifting (figurines,mugs,blankets etc) as well as the largest collection of titles that don't fit into what is new and hot at the moment. Anything that they don't carry can actually be ordered in for you but I have to say staff here are not always the best at phoning customers to let them know when their titles are in so one should definitely keep their number by the phone to check in with them after a week or so.

The biggest selling point for me here besides the selection has to be the staff at the tills. It can get a little busy here but lines are always dealt with quickly and I appreciate that they don't push as hard as other locations to try and sign you up for a pure card. F.Y.I to anybody considering the pure rewards program the redemption items are not that great. It took me about a year of collecting just to accumulate enough points for a true blood key chain and when I got it it was placed in a bubble mailer and not even in it's original packaging. Needless to say when it came time to renew the card I opted out.

Anyways to sum it all up I will say for selection and speedy service these guys get five stars but the prices as well as the sometimes slow ordering process drop it down to a 3. Still worth checking out though if you have been on the hunt at smaller stores for a particular movie or cd.",3
1938,"My trip to SB for my step-sisters wedding was during grad week, so i knew the rates were going to be on the higher end. Ive been shopping around and when i came across this hotel's website, it looked like a good deal considering the location, appearance and price. The rate was $160 the first night and $180 the 2nd. When my boyfriend and i arrived,i thought we were in the wrong place.. i couldnt believe THIS was where we were staying! It looked like a run down motel. The Motel 6 next door looked like a 4 star compared to this place.
When my bf went to ""check in"" the guy told us its late  so we can take care of the paperwork in the morning, the rooms unlocked and the keys are inside. (wtf?) When we got inside, the room looked NOTHING like the pictures on the website. I felt like i was scammed. The lamps were the ONLY thing that the pics and actual room had in common, other then that everything from the ceiling to the carpet were different!!!! All we wanted to do was have a relaxing weekend and stay in our hotel room but after seeing the room (it just looked dirty and unkempt), we couldnt even stand being in there another minute. We noticed that they offer free wifi so we decided to start looking for rooms near by, and of course... the wifi was so bad that we couldnt even connect to the internet!! The door had a sign with crime dog Mcgruff (Mcgruff?? seriously?! i didnt know he was still around) giving some pointers on how to keep safe... a few things to mention were 
- always lock doors and windows ( windows didnt even have latches)
- if someone poses as an employee do not open the door 
- do not draw attention to yourself such as wearing flashy jewelry, clothes etc. 

We decided to leave and drive around and call to find another place... at about 2AM we finally found a place, a little bit more expensive but worth EVERY penny!!! 

All in all the reason i am so upset is because of false advertisement and they still went ahead and charged us even after the fact that we had told them that we left because the rooms were nothing like what their website showed.  I will NEVER believe a website again and especially this one.",1
1939,"The French woman who owns the place ruined the experience for me.  She doesn't seem to have any respect for her stylists or staff.  Her concern was that halfway through my haircut, there was hair on the floor.  She whispered to my stylist to leave me and next thing I know my stylist is coming back with a broom to sweep up the hair. Who does that??  I have short hair, and not much of it so it looked like a really pissy move.  I felt intruded on, and such empathy for my stylist who, by the way, was the ultimate professional and gave me the best hair ever!  I don't patronize a salon, I faithfully follow a talented stylist.  Flamboyant untalented French lady ruins it for me every time.  Hoping my favorite stylist moves to another salon soon!",1
1940,hands down my favorite bar in East Nashville. it's super close to my house and away from the 5 Points madness. just wish they stayed open a little later.,4
1941,Love this place. Mushroom soup is amazing ! We had the ahi tuna and meatloaf . Both were delicious.,4
1942,Improvement is slow.  Food is same but at least they have a few friendlier people.  I wish they offered some specials.,2
1943,"Not impressive at all, I ordered turkey hummus wraps, turned out that half of my wraps barely contained any turkey! Only green and hummus. What a surprise!",2
1944,"A quasi political rant and a store review all wrapped in one, so enjoy. 

Ever since Target hit the scene I really have to ask, ""Who even goes to Kmart anymore?"" I asked this to myself out loud the other day as I had to get my meds filled due to a sinus infection. No one looked at me odd, as there seemed to be several people talking to themselves. I now go here because of the stolid contractual war between Express Scripts and Walgreens. Thanks you two....idiots.....qausi-political rant over.

This store is harshly bright, rather dingy, and the selections, especially in the electronic section, are on the cheaper end.  On top of that, I've found the mainstream DVD and Blu-Ray movies are overpriced.  I laughed at the men's area, especially the young man's department, as they had a tv with music videos playing. I laughed because it just seemed a lame attempt to be cool and creating a shopping experience that you will find at a department store like Macy's or Dillard's. This is hard to create when everything is whitewashed. You will feel like you are in that August Burns Red's ""Whitewashed.""  The best WTF moment is discovering the opportunity to purchase Joe Boxer male thongs. Who knew that Kmart cared about male panty line?

One great tip is you can find patio furniture cheap during the off season and clearance days. I bought a great patio table for under $50. So, keep that in mind.

The extra star is for the pharmacy, as they filled my prescription out efficiently and with the greatest of ease. The hours are little later than Target.  No problems there and credit when credit is due!

The later 80s quote, ""K-Mart sucks"", remains as true as ever and who knows, you may even bump into someone who still dresses from that Tom Cruise era who cares about male panty line. One never knows?",2
1945,"So disappointed.   Brought a friend from out of town there because I heard it was great..... horrible all the way around.   Cold air from floor vents  the Tom Kai, bland at best. The muscles small, over cooked and cold.  But worst they had me running for a bathroom an hour later.   Totally got sick from it.  :/  still sick from it.    Please do yourself a favor don't eat here.  Thai Phooket 1000 times better and half the price.",1
1946,"Came here before Hurricane Irene hit for a quick brunch.  Was visiting for the weekend and this placed looked busy, so why not?!

We were seated and the waitress came to take our order soon. Banana brioche french toast with dulce de leche sauce for about 10 bucks and salmon benedict for 11.50, with a side of fruit salad for 4.50.

Shortly after we were seated, the manager that morning asked to move us to a nearby booth, as he was expecting a large wedding party. We didn't mind, and even better, he said that he would take care of our breakfast for our helpfulness.

The food was standard brunch fare, but what really stuck out was the banana brioche french toast with the dulce de leche. My boyfriend was crying as he ate it. Crying.

I was just so impressed with the customer service. Definitely would come back for a quick bite to eat.",4
1947,"The pizza had no taste and the wings that I ordered didn't even come buffalo, they came plain which I know for a fact I asked for mild wings... even the chicken was flavorless. Won't be ordering again.",1
1948,"We just had dinner at Avalon on a suggestion from our friends.  We had 715 reservations and were a couple minutes late, but we were seated immediately which was nice. Karen our server was great, very knowledgable and very helpful in deciphering the ""chefs choice"", menu. We had meatballs, mussels, cheese platter and buffalo chicken crisps which were good, and for our main menu, my wife had linguini and clams and I had lamb bolognese. All good but not great as the price implicated. For $75 per person without tip and drinks I expect to be wowed by the food which I was not.  Nice quaint place and friendly staff.",3
1949,"Omg!! This place is a zoo, never mind the clientele but let's talk about the stocking of food. I roamed the isle for my weekly grocery shopping trip to come to the realization that Walmart has ran out of food. The produce section was empty and what was there was already spoiled, the meat department was emptied, the seafood department actually had food in it. As I walked the rest of the isles I looked for anything that I normally buy but no luck. I ended up going to shop-rite just to finish shopping.",1
1950,"I used to love Pizza Mizza. Something happened the past couple of years. The pizza is a a little thinner, a few less toppings and things like the kids eat for a dollar special is not really a full kids meal nor is is $1.00 ($1.79) I keep going because the service is always great, the location is good, and the half price pizza deal used to be good. Not sure if they are trying to save pennies or there was a change in management.",3
1951,Friendly owner and great atmosphere. Food is decent for the area. Will definitely visit again,4
1952,Food and service very good. Only complaint is that the children's portion is tiny! (at least the lo mein is!) good for a5 or 6 year old not pre-teens!,4
1953,"I made an appointment for my Chevy Volt for regular maintenance.  After waiting quite a while to be taken care of, we were told there was no Volt mechanic working today.  WHY WOULD THEY MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO WORK ON A VOLT WITH NO MECHANIC ON SITE!!??  IDIOTS.  

The service advisor then spoke with the service manager to see if the car could be left and he could provide a loaner.  Mike Gullo, the manager said since we purchased the car at another dealership, they WOULDN'T PROVIDE A LOANER.  You've got to be kidding me!  What difference does it make where I purchased the vehicle??  

I will drive where ever I have to in order to find another Chevy dealer with whom to work.",1
1954,"Got the vegan bowl and my sister got the vegan burrito with siracha cauliflower in it(the best tasting cauliflower by the way).  We also got the loaded vegan fries. Overall, the second best vegan meal. Will be back soon!",4
1955,"I'll be charitable and say that they are totally incompetent, probably worst service team ever.

After my last experience, I thought I'd give them another chance since they are closest to where I live, so it is more convenient.  

Took my van in for oil change.  The van also had vibrations at high speeds.  They said tires need rotation and balance, gave estimated time of 1 hour for the whole thing.

It took them an hour to come back and tell me that two of the tires need changing, and that it will take another 1 - 1.5 hours.  (Why couldn't they tell me that as soon as they started on the tires?)

These are the run-flat tires that only Honda can change.  So, cursing the day I decided to buy an Odyssey, I agree to shell out about $800 additional.  Another hour later they told me that it needs some kind of a ring, another $150.

Well, 4 hours and more $1,000 later, I drove off -- the vibrations were still there!  They told me that the mechanic had taken it for a test drive after fixing it, but clearly either someone was lying or they are just nincompoops.

Immediately took it back,  and this is when their genius really impressed me -- without taking another look, or even taking it for a test drive, they said that I need a new axle which would normally be $840, but they will give me a 25% discount (because they are so magnanimous I suppose).

Finally I left and on the way back home, the engine light came on!  Called them and of course, they asked me to bring it back so they can take a look.

Have others had similar experiences with them?  Is this systematic?

If anyone at Honda (not a dealer/service person) is reading this:  what does ""Honda Certified"" mean?  All the people in the service department were Honda Certified.  Does it mean that you are capable of getting out of bed, putting on clothes and coming to work?  Also, really disappointed the way that the proprietary run-flat tire mechanism forces us to get our van fixed at high priced and incompetent dealer shops.",1
1956,"They're rude and need to learn how to be respectful. If you go through the drive-thru, they carry on their conversations while you're trying to order. You can hear them laughing and talking to their coworkers from the speaker. I had to repeat myself several times because she was talking to someone else and she couldn't hear me. In the end, she got my order wrong. Plus, she said that there would be a 4 minute wait on the biscuits, and I didn't get my food about 20 minutes. The food is great but terrible service...",1
1957,"We ended up here with drink coupons from our hotel and what luck that was.  We are not bar people, so finding a nice bar was a treat, especially after walking on Bourbon Street and seeing all the alcohol walking around.

Chris, the owner, is very friendly and fun to chat with.  The cocktails are creative and I am hoping to be able to duplicate one at home.

They have local musicians come in to play and that was just what we were looking for....It seems people walking by were drawn in by the music.  With all the bars in the French Quarter, we visited only one...two nights in a row!

Good luck to Chris and his staff as they make this into a destination...just hope there are two empty seats if we visit again!",5
1958,"Loud loud loud!

And the food sucks. They got new management not too long along, doubt they made an improvements.",1
1959,"I had the Chicken Marsala recommended by our waiter. The chicken was very thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was under cooked and stuck together. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food.",2
1960,"I was drawn to this place by positive reviews, but was fooled again.  Still can't find a decent pizza place in Delaware County.  Their pizza had minimal toppings, not much cheese with lots of grease on the bottom.  After eating a little I trashed most of the pie since I'm not fond of oily bottomed crust.  Much better pizza available in Philly.",1
1961,"Here's their slogan:  ""Moving is hard.  Green Truck makes it harder! ""

I'll give you a breakdown of their rate structure:  

They charge $115 per hour for a two man crew with a two and a half hour minimum.  You're thinking, ""The last time I moved this one bedroom apartment worth of stuff it was just me a friend and it didn't take two hours.  Surely professionals will take less time than that!""  You will be wrong.

At the $115 an hour rate, you want these guys to hustle.  They will not.  Anything that is not in a box will be meticulously wrapped in a moving blanket and covered in tape.  I mean, EVERYTHING will be individually wrapped.  Not just fragile items.  They would wrap your Brita pitcher.  This is their prime means of riding the clock and screwing you out of your money.  Remember: they don't have a sense of urgency.  They're just two dudes riding the clock.  The less of a hurry they're in, the more money they make.

So a job that should be knocked out in two and a half hours will take four and a half.  That's $517.50 as a base rate.

Then comes their ""transportation fee"".  This fee is not for transporting your things to your new place.  This is a fee for driving from their office downtown to your house, and then back when they're done.  It works out to about $160 an hour (they charged me $86 for what was at most 30 minutes of drive time).  They want $160 an hour to drive and empty truck to and from work.  

They also tack on 10% for fuel charges.  At my day job I dispatch trucks, and adding on a fuel surcharge is common.  But the way Green does it is not honest, nor is it the industry standard in trucking.  Honest trucking companies charge a fuel surcharge based on the distance traveled.  For instance, Nashville to Smyrna should be about ten dollars. But Green charges you fuel based on the total move time, not the total travel time.   They charge for ""fuel"" when they're not driving the truck.  I paid $51.75 in fuel for ten minutes of drive time.  

So to move a one bedroom apartment with no stairs, they will charge you about $665.",1
1962,It is connected to the original Galatoire's and so in some ways this is sort of just extra space for the original restaurant but they do offer a different menu.  The steak is good and the service is professional.  The downstairs bar here is large and comfortable so it might be a good place to drink if the upstairs bar at original Galatoire's is full.  Generally I would prefer dining in the original Galatorie's but if it was full I wouldn't mind eating here again.  You can also access Galatorie's 33 from the upstairs bar at Galatorie's.  The dress code here is more relaxed than the original so if you find yourself in a more business casual mood then this might be a better choice than the original Galatorie's.,3
1963,Honestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order.,3
1964,"I can't really say enough good things about BK's northern location. If you want the prices and quality of a good taqueria, but want a nicer sit down atmosphere with table service, I don't think that you can find a better place.
BK's is famous for their Sonoran dogs now, but their other food is just as fantastic, if not better. I would submit that they have some of the best carne asada in town. Cheap too. Tacos run $1.50 (cheaper than Nico's even), and not just for the asada ones: their pastor meat is also fantastic and runs at the same price. Great tortillas and they come loaded with meat.
A favorite of mine is also the caramelo, usually the carne asada one (I think the pastor tastes funny with all that cheese). They have a small and large size, but only the small comes with the corn tortilla option. Personally, I like their corn tortillas better.
As far as the dogs go, they run $2.50 per and come with a nice grilled pepper. They have a condiment bar that includes two kinds of cheese, guacamole, red salsa, green salsa, cucumbers, avocado sauce, radishes, etc., etc. That alone should make this a higher-end place but, like I said, it's really very cheap.
The service is always really nice too. They'll take your order at your table, refill your waters, even pick up your check when you're done. The servers always do a good job.
Honestly, I haven't tried the majority of the items on the BK menu, just because I can't get past my standards. If I go, I have to get a hot dog and a carne asada taco or caramelo. If I don't get those, I'm always left with a ""What if?"" in my mind.
The only negative I'd give out is that their chicken sucks. Seriously. It's that fake, water-injected stuff. Why the other meats are so great and this one is so terrible I don't really understand, but you just need to stay away from the chicken options. Get at least a carne asada taco.
So if you've never been, you should go down. Probably now. They're good for lunch and dinner. They even have breakfast!",5
1965,"This is a close grocery store to me and while convenient, it is incredibly pricy. Things may even be a $1 or 2 more than Frys. I only go when its easiest for me.

It is a nice place to grab some prepared food, breakfast or hard to find ethnic foods. 

Great wine selection.

Will go again... only when I need to. 

I usually buy all my birthday cakes (when needed/parties) here. They do a great job.",3
1966,"I was in town for business and after checking into my hotel, I searched for the closest BBQ place. I wasn't sure what I'd find at Hendricks but I was pleasantly surprised as I was driving through the neighborhood. I liked the small town feel. Since I was by myself, I had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside, I had to stay to enjoy the decor. Light bulbs in mason jars, flat screen TV's and an amazing lighted patio. Although the view is just a parking lot, it's too bad it wasn't closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at. 

I ordered pork steak (which I've never heard of before) and it was really good. It looked like a T-bone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork. For my sides, I chose collard greens and cole slaw. The cole slaw was awesome. I have a weird ritual where I always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it. This one is definitely in my top 5. The slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it, which I love. I usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect. Cold and with a kick. Collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too. If I had more time or with a group of friends, I'd definitely come back because everything looked comfortably country.",5
1967,"Great margaritas.
good service.
clean establishment.
space enough between tables.
indoor and outdoor seating.
good locale.

food: I wasn't impressed with my taco choices.  I got the Korean BBQ, and the special country fried chicken and gravy.
Neither jumped out at me and made me happy.  Very little substance in the taco.. (tiny quantity), and no real pizzazz as far as cilantro, shredded cabbage, whatever...  very dull, in fact.   Salsa was mediocre, as well..

So - food 3.
Everything else 4-5.

I would go back for a pitcher of margaritas, but I'd probably bring my own salsa.",3
1968,Stopped in for breakfast and so glad we did. Delicious food and great service. Got the hash. Definitely try the sage sausage.,5
1969,"Cool place if anyone would wait on you.  Hung around for 15 minutes and watched the bartender and wait staff chat at the bar.  There's plenty of places to drink in the casino.

I find it strange how Peppermill prices identical food and drink items differently between establishments in the casino.",1
1970,"We have recently moved to the area from out of state and were super surprised by this place! The menu is huge, and all of it is available 24/7. EVERYTHING looks homemade, no freezer and microwave here. The donut selection looks amazing and the staff was really friendly. We can't wait to go back and take family as a treat when they come to visit as it's a local feature to the NOLA area.",5
1971,"Stumbled upon this place while walking around Philly. Way cool toy store!! They had unique and interesting toys- stuff you can't find at a Toys R Us. We went in there as adults and even found a couple new games. Definitely worth stopping in. They even put a cute joke outside, just ask an employee for the punch line. Very cute!",5
1972,"This place continues to amaze me each and every time I use them. From the initial purchase of our Forte5, to the unlimited car washes, and finally even through a minor recall, they have been simply amazing. 

Truly one of the few great dealerships remaining in the area. It's sad that I am moving from the area, as I will miss visiting Friendly Kia. :(",5
1973,Had the buckaroo burger. Too expensive for what you get. If the meat is high quality why feel the need to cover it up with so many other ingredients and condiments???  Granted I'm not a huge burger fan to begin with but the quality did not warrant the price.,3
1974,"Love this place!  Discovered it two weeks ago and have eaten there twice already. My fave is the Bun Hue soup, a giant bowl of spicy goodness that I reluctantly share. They serve it with shredded greens, sprouts, jalapenos and wedges of lime. I added a little of each and a lot of lime to really brighten the flavors. 

The two of us also shared an order of spring rolls (one of my must-haves), and a  vermicelli bowl filled with beef, chicken, shrimp and, yep, more spring rolls. All of it was really good--and plentiful, though the shrimp didn't pack quite the flavor punch the rest of the meats did. Still, would order it again in a heartbeat. It's a great value. As for the rest of the meal, it was a tough choice--just too many goodies to choose from. The first time we had the egg crepe. It was stuffed with bean sprouts, onions and shrimp (they were right on point).  The second time we had the pork ""tacos"". The shell was a folded over steam bun. It was filled with grilled pork and some fresh salad fixings (cucumbers, carrots).  The order came with two. Add the complementary hot tea and you're in for a real treat. 

One other thing...the service was spot on. Our waitress (I've only seen the one) was very helpful (she suggested the tacos). If you're not sure what to order, ask her. She really knows the menu and seems to really want you to enjoy your meal.",4
1975,"I came today for brunch. I've been for dinner before and thought it was just okay, so I figured brunch couldn't be half bad. I was in the area, the weather was nice, and there was no wait, so we decided to stop.

Pros: dog friendly patio and a very nice (albeit slow) waiter. He also brought a bowl of water for said dog.

Cons: everything else

Service was very slow. Parties that ordered after us received their food first.

We ordered an omelet and the French toast. First of all, the French toast is deep fried. Nothing in the description on the menu alluded to the fact that I would be served deep fried bread for breakfast. In what world does French toast = deep fried bread? It only tasted like oil, and when I poked the bread oil just oozed out. So essentially you're eating oil soaked bread for breakfast. Drowning it in syrup didn't help with the flavor either. 

The omelet also came out and was clearly covered in oil. Surprise surprise, it also just tasted like oil. It was served with 2 cold pieces of toast.

Unless you enjoy eating oil for breakfast, you're better off waiting in line at Fido or heading down the street to J Christopher's. You'll get much better food for a similar (if not cheaper) price.",2
1976,Atmosphere was nice and the fish tank was awesome. Service was bad and food was mediocre. The main dining room was about half full and that was all they could accommodate because they didn't have the staff. Ended up sitting at the bar. Got the fish tacos and there was very little fish actually in there. Not impressed :( had high hopes,2
1977,"Very fresh and tasty but chinsy on the meat (I had the roast beef and cheese primo).  With all the great places to dine in, take out or otherwise satiate your soul with some of the best food on the planet, I will not return here.",3
1978,"July 2015.  I have to say that I was very disappointed with our last visit.  They were out of so much food.  The basics for any kids meal, all of the fish items, no salads...  what is going on here? ??  The staff was very passive about the issue, and told us they only had the burgers available.  
The kids do love this place because if the play area,  and the picnic tables.  
I hope things are improved when we visit in a couple months.",2
1979,"Buddy Brew is Tampa's best coffee shop and a local powerhouse in the coffee roasting community. Everywhere in town that serves coffee (or rather, cares about the coffee they serve) brews with beans from Buddy Brew.

The only problem with Buddy Brew is its popularity! The current space could use more parking and seats.",4
1980,"We were really looking forward to what the new lighthouse restaurant was going to look like, considering SB doesn't have many places to eat on the water.  It's nice, but what a misuse of space overlooking the water.  The patio is a joke, luckily the bar does have a view, still not the best use of window space.
The food was OK.  Nothing that I would have to go back to visit.  
What I couldn't understand, is it was FREEZING at the bar, was an overcast day, but no employee cared that the AC was on full blast and as we sat at the bar, three people complained to the female bartender who was a little snobby about the LA bread- great, we're in SB, source local, but she ignored everyone who said it was freezing, so she probably lost at least $60 in tips for 3 couples leaving the bar, on a not busy day.",2
1981,The food is excellent but the margaritas leave something to be desired. I would absolutely come here again for lunch (or for a Dos Equis) but I would try someplace else for a stellar marg. We have the enchiladas verdes and pollo y chorizo con queso and they were some of the best in town. Prices were excellent too!,4
1982,"Very cool atmosphere at Old Glory.  It is an old laundry service building and they have left some details of its past life in the new bar.   I was excited to check it out because I love a good cocktail!  The cocktails are good but small and very expensive!! I'd suggest to order off menu to get a better deal.  Now that is if you can figure out how to order.  We were hanging out on the mid level and a waiter would come by every hour or so but not frequent enough to keep with the demand of my group. 
I'd probably never be back to Old Glory because it's not my scene (to club/city for me).",3
1983,"It was Wednesday night August 10 when we reached Saint Louis, Missouri. I asked a local leaving the stadium where we could find good food at this hour. He did not hesitate to point straight ahead to the place with the red white and green striped awning. This must be an Italian place! I thought. 

I am taking away one star because of how rude the hostess was when we four stepped inside. Instead of ""Good evening"", ""Welcome to Caleco's"" or even just plain old ""Hi!"", she quickly snaps at us with ""We only have pizza and appetizers,"" wearing an ugly frown. We first wanted to order take-out but changed our minds. This cool guy Kevin took our orders and promptly brought us our chicken fingers with honey mustard, and excellently prepared fried calamari.

It was Kevin's great customer service and the absolutely delicious food that prevented a one star review and brought it way up to four stars instead. This guy Kevin of course had to run back and forth all over the place since it was a busy night but he still managed to take the time to keep our cups of water full and to make sure we had everything we needed.

Then came the hostess again or whatever title she has, to take our plates. I reached for another plate at the same time and I guess that interrupted her endeavors to take another plate away or something silly and she made this really mean face like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum (it was kind of adorable, you should have seen it! Made us almost say ""awwwww"" and give her a cookie to improve her feewings). It seemed like she was angry that we came to her restaurant. It was ridiculous and we laughed and made jokes about it after we left, imagining all the hilarious reasons she could have been miserable.",4
1984,"Came for a late Sunday lunch. Got a booth by the huge open air wall-window with my son. Friendly attentive staff. Nice selection of booze and drinks (but I had iced tea.)  Stylish decor. The meal was good, but not great. I'd happily come back just for the cool vibe and keep my meal expectations in check.",4
1985,"To Good: The beer list. I like the good selection of beer that they had on the menu. 

The Bad: The service. We went in midweek prior to the dinner rush -- around 4:30 and our server had only like 2 tables. She kept disappearing into the back and took forever for things like refills. 

The Ugly: The food and the cost. We tried three different pies and only one of them was worth ordering a second time. Additionally, since this place is on the craft pizza bandwagon, their prices certainly reflect that and I'm not sure I'd visit again knowing that.",2
1986,"Food is amazing, beers are good, prices are a big steep.  The atmosphere is incredible though.  Absolutely love the vibe of this place",4
1987,"Sat outside by the fountain and had a pleasant lunch. Fish sandwich was fresh and delicious and the potato chips were fresh and warm.  Cold beer, nice breeze, and what more could you ask for?",4
1988,"Question:  What do you do when you're only in St Louis for 16 hours or less?

Answer:  You go to Pi for dinner and then order an additional 2 large deep dish pizza's to go too!

Well you would if you were me!  That's pretty much exactly what we did.  We enjoyed most of a large deep dish Bucktown at the restaurant and took a large deep dish Berkley and South Side Classico to go.

However, the smell of Pi filling a little car for 5 hours is fairly intoxicating.  We lasted about 2 hours before we made a pit stop for another slice while on the road.  

So looking forward to reheating a slice for dinner, it reheats pretty well in a toaster oven or the regular oven.  My mouth waters just thinking about it.  

Does Pi deliver to Chicago?  How about Milwaukee?",5
1989,"This location gets no stars! I only chose 1 so that this will post. The manager is completely disrespectful! DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! CHOOSE ANOTHER RENTAL CAR COMPANY! I almost lost my salvation on the manager, she couldn't even look me in the eye when I came to the counter to check out. I spoke with her the day before about removing my insurance that I did not need because my company covers it and she still said that because they are a private company they operate differently. National Rental needs to be notified that there are locations that use their name and do not even have high expectations when it comes to customer service.",1
1990,"I was really expecting a little more from this hotel. Probably just because of the name. The first issue I had is that after a 14 Hour Dr. to get there it would have been nice to have a free cup of coffee in the reception area. You can get that at any super eight motel. Instead you have to buy a cup of coffee for three dollars if you want one Badly enough. I mean, coffee is really inexpensive but it goes along way in the name of hospitality. That is the name of the hotel business, right?. The interior is slightly dated although I won't hold that against them . I was disappointed that for the price of the room we had light sockets hanging out of the wall and a ripped shower curtain. Also, I had called down to the front desk to inquire about getting a wheelchair because we had a guest with us who is having a hard time walking. I was told by the concierge that they would locate their wheelchair and call me back. I never received a call back and that was most disappointing Of all.",2
1991,"Under new management, Tandoor has the best Indian food we have had in Philadelphia.
They reguiarly change their buffet offerings, are concerned about their ingredients, and offer wonderful flavors. Their vegetable soup is a particular favorite. They have done a great deal to improve the appearance of the restaurant (especially the bathrooms). We go there about once a week. My only reservation is their tandoor chicken. It is just OK. However, the rest of the food on the buffet is so good, the tandoor chicken can be easily ignored.",4
1992,"Really this should be Zero stars. I'm not sure how this particular location can be consistently bad for so long. I live not far from this location, but I will usually drive farther to another location because from top to bottom this location fails. Every once and a while, like today, I'll stop by and see if they were able to turn it around. Well, I'm sad to say that they still are awful. I'm really shocked that this location is able to stay in business this long. 
I went through the drive thru and ordered a KFC value meal. 15 minutes later I got my food. Apologies? Are you kidding? I had clearly inconvenienced the staff by being a paying customer. They essentially tossed me my food without saying even ""thank you"" or ""come again"". I drove away (my mistake) and noticed when I got home that my drink was wrong, I received no napkins and no plastic ware. 
Overall, this place has consistently the worst fast food staffing that I have ever seen. Who ever manages this location should be ashamed and consider another profession. Do yourself a favor and go to the Wendy's next door, they are consistently good.",1
1993,Good sushi. Everything tasted fresh! The fried rice and seaweed salad were delicious too. Service was great. We went on a Monday night around 7:30 and there were only a few other people eating. Very reasonable prices too! Couldn't believe the glasses of wine were only $4! I will definitely be returning or getting take out from here sometime soon.,4
1994,"We had went to a movie at the nearby Carmike Cinemas and decided to check out what was nearby... as beer fans we decided to give the new Cool Springs Brewery a try. Once inside, we headed for the bar (we'd been here once before when it was Guidos). It took awhile for us to get the bartender to come over to us... she was busy talking with a group of guys. Once we did get her attention, we'd ordered a beer, but one of the ""guys"" yelled something out to her and she left our beers where the tap was and went to talk to him... not great. 

Once we finally got our Fatback Amber's... they were pretty tasty. We were hungry for lunch and we drank our entire beer + 10 minutes before we could get the bartenders attention (and for the record... the only people in the bar were the 3-4 guys she was talking to and my husband and I... so it wasn't busy). We finally got a menu and I asked her to just wait a second because we wanted to order... we got the white pizza (something we'd had before when it was Guidos... and loved) and two more fatback amber's. 

About 20 minutes later we got our pizza.... and it wasn't what we'd remembered. The pizza was bland and didn't have nearly enough pesto or ricotta.

It took us another 15 minutes after we were done with our pizza and 2nd beers to get her attention and get our check. It was getting pretty annoying. 

We really did like their beer and the location/decor/vibe are all good... but the service and the pizza left a lot to be desired. I'd like to say we'll be back, but I'm not certain we will, and it makes me sad because they have a lot of potential to make it fantastic... but right now they're missing the mark.",2
1995,"What a pleasant surprise! I try to bring in treats every now and then for work an since it was a rainy day today, it was perfect timing. When I walked in I was greeted by the ladies behind the counter, they made me feel like I was at home. I wanted to get a lot of bagels so they took the time and went thru all of my options and different menu choices that would cover all basis for a large group. 

They had an array of homemade cream cheese, I tried the chive and it is officially my new favorite. The assortment of bagels and sandwiches I purchased were fair priced and got rave reviews from any and all that tried them. I even got a call asking where they were located so a friend could go themselves. The only issue I had was the coffee, when I went to pour myself some a regular it was empty, then a columbian also empty I'm not sure which I settled for but once I did the milk and half and half were also both empty. I will make the trek to them again, and soon.",4
1996,"Tucked in a cozy spot on Watson, Yolklore is the type of restaurant I wouldn't expect in Crestwood. Normally a place like this would be downtown or in Clayton. Curious to find a place like this close by my husband and I was excited to try it out.

The space and decor is like most breakfast places: tight and cozy. The kitchen is open faced and there are coffee mugs, the menu, and a listing of the specials to greet you right at the door. 

I ordered the Bread Pudding French Toast and my husband ordered a basic breakfast plate. The french toast was good, the eggs my husband had were extraordinary and I really liked the direction they took with the potatoes, using whole yukon gold potatoes instead of cubed potatoes. 

I had a smoothie and he had the orange juice. I liked the smoothie but felt it was missing something. 

I noticed the manager touching tables as I ate, checking to see how everyone was enjoying their meal.

I enjoyed eating here, however I felt it was on the pricey side ($28 for two people) for breakfast.",3
1997,Excellent pedicure! I am a salon owner and I know a good pedicure when I get one ! Keep up the good work !,5
1998,Ate lunch on a busy Friday and had just a couple minute wait to be seated . The place was packed but service was quick and accurate.  The wife and I both had some healthy low calorie meals.  Much better than my last visit and more of  what I  expected of the restaurant after eating at several across the country.,4
1999,"The first time I ordered from here it was solid. Matzo ball soup was good and they gave me crackers. The turkey burger wasn't that great, but edible. This time, I got the soup with a tuna sandwich. I asked for no extra mayo but got it anyway. I asked for a Dr. Pepper and got root beer, and then this time no crackers! Bummer. so yeah, I've had better experiences with delis. The tuna is pretty good though. I guess I'd order again, but wouldn't be my first choice.",3
